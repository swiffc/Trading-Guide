---

#### 5. **Risk Management Page** - PENDING
**Needs Enhancement:**

- **Position Sizing Formula**
  ```
  Position Size = Risk Amount ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
  
  For Forex (per pip):
  Position Size = Risk Amount ÷ Stop Loss Distance in Pips
  
  Example:
  Risk: $100
  Stop Loss: 40 pips
  $100 ÷ 40 = $2.50 per pip
  ```

- **Scaling Out Strategy** (Already partially covered, enhance)
  - TP1 (50%): 1:1 or first major level, move to BE
  - TP2 (30%): 2:1 or second major level, trail stop
  - TP3 (20%): 3:1+ or trail with 50 EMA

- **Maximum Loss Limits**
  - Daily: 3-5% max
  - Weekly: 5-10% max
  - If hit, stop for that period

- **Break-Even Rules**
  - After TP1 hit (always)
  - If up 1:1 RR
  - Before major news
  - End of session
  - Add 5-10 pips beyond BE (for spread)

- **Trailing Stop Methods**
  - EMA Trail: 13 EMA (aggressive) or 50 EMA (conservative)
  - Fixed Pip: After 50 pips → trail 20, after 100 → trail 40
  - Structure Trail: Behind each new swing point

**Integration:**
- Reference all 34 setups
- Setup-specific stop placements
- Time-based considerations
