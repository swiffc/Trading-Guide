- 📅 3-Day Cycle
- 📊 Summary

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Main Category Tabs
- **Large, bold buttons** with gradient backgrounds
- **Blue gradient** for Chart Patterns (📊)
- **Green gradient** for Trading Setups (🎯)

- Font size: 1.1rem, padding: 1rem 2rem

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Logic
**File:** `pages/chart-models.html` (inline script at bottom)

**Key Features:**
1. **Main Tab Switching**: Toggles between Patterns and Setups sections
2. **Sub-Tab Switching**: Shows/hides individual pattern or setup content
3. **Auto-Activation**: Clicking a main tab automatically activates the first sub-tab
4. **Section Isolation**: Sub-tabs only affect content within their parent section
5. **Smart Initialization**: Patterns section visible by default, first pattern auto-activated

**Event Listeners:**
- Main tabs: Toggle section visibility, trigger first sub-tab
- Sub-tabs: Show/hide individual content within active section

**Selectors:**
```javascript
mainTabs: '[data-tab="patterns-section"], [data-tab="setups-section"]'
subTabs: All other '.tab-button' elements
allContent: All '.tab-content' divs
```

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

- **Flex-wrap enabled** on both main and sub-tabs
- **Touch-friendly** button sizes
- **Responsive gaps** between buttons
- **Scrollable** tab rows on small screens
