## Introduction & Philosophy

This guide merges two powerful methodologies:

**Trader Daye's Quarterly Theory**: A time-based framework that divides all timeframes into predictable quarterly cycles following the A-M-D-X pattern (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution, Reversal/Continuation).

**Steve Mauro's BTMM**: A market maker behavioral approach that identifies the 3-day cycle of institutional manipulation, focusing on following "smart money" rather than fighting against it.

### Core Philosophy
- **Time + Price = Edge**: Combine precise timing (Quarterly Theory) with market maker psychology (BTMM)
- **Trade WITH institutions, not against them**
- **The market manipulates to accumulate, then distributes the real move**
- **Every timeframe operates fractally with the same pattern**

---

## Understanding Both Methodologies

### Quarterly Theory Core Concepts

#### Fractal Time Division
All timeframes follow the same quarterly structure:

- **Yearly**: Q1 (Jan-Mar), Q2 (Apr-Jun), Q3 (Jul-Sep), Q4 (Oct-Dec)
- **Monthly**: 4 weeks each
- **Weekly**: Mon (Q1), Tue (Q2), Wed (Q3), Thu (Q4) - Friday is special
- **Daily**: 6-hour quarters (4 sessions)
- **Session**: 90-minute quarters
- **90-Min**: 22.5-minute micro quarters

#### The A-M-D-X Cycle

1. **Q1 - Accumulation (A)**: Tight consolidation, ranging price action
2. **Q2 - Manipulation (M)**: Judas Swing - false move to trap traders
3. **Q3 - Distribution (D)**: Real move begins, easiest to trade
4. **Q4 - Reversal/Continuation (X)**: Market decides next direction

**Alternative Pattern**: X-A-M-D (cycle begins with reversal/continuation)

#### True Opens (Critical Reference Points)

- **True Year Open**: April's opening price
- **True Month Open**: Monday of the 2nd full week
- **True Week Open**: Tuesday midnight (00:00)
- **True Day Open**: Midnight (00:00)
- **True Session Opens**:
  - London: 1:30 AM EST
  - New York: 7:30 AM EST
  - Afternoon: 1:30 PM EST
  - Asia: 7:30 PM EST

**Trading Rule**: 
- On **bullish** bias days → Enter LONGS **below** True Opens
- On **bearish** bias days → Enter SHORTS **above** True Opens

### BTMM Core Concepts

#### Market Maker Objectives
- Accumulate maximum contracts/volume
- Induce retail traders into wrong positions
- Trigger stop losses for liquidity
- Reverse price direction for profit
- Manipulate price through volume imbalances

#### The 3-Day Cycle

**Day 1**: Initial manipulation/stop hunt establishes Peak Formation (PF)
- Market makers create the high or low for the week
- Retail traders are induced into positions
- Volume begins accumulating

**Day 2**: Continuation of accumulation against the PF
- Price continues to trap more traders
- More volume accumulates on wrong side
- Market makers build positions opposite to retail

**Day 3**: Distribution and reversal
- Real move begins against retail positions
- Stop losses are triggered providing liquidity
- Market makers profit from the reversal
- Pattern: M-A1-A2-W (downtrend) or W-V1-V2-M (uptrend)

#### Intraday BTMM Cycle

**5:00 PM EST** - Reset/Accumulation Phase
- Daily high/low reset
- Market makers start accumulating contracts
- Push price up 15-25 pips, pull back, go sideways
- Building volume in tight range (Asian session)

**1:00-4:00 AM EST** - Stop Hunt Phase (London Open)
- Break out of Asian range in "3 swipes"
- Establish High/Low of Day (HOD/LOD)
- Trap breakout traders
- Spread widens to trigger orders
- 30-90 minute re-accumulation period

**6:00 AM - 12:00 PM EST** - Distribution Phase (NY Session)
- Real trend begins after manipulation
- 6-8 hour slow and steady move
- This is the money-making phase
- Trade with the institutional flow

**12:00 PM onwards** - Return to Accumulation/Reversal
- Price trends back toward center
- Often returns near market open price
- New accumulation begins for next cycle

#### M & W Patterns (Core BTMM Setups)

**M Pattern** (Top/Bearish Reversal):
- Forms at the high of a move
- Created by stop hunts above resistance
- Traps buyers
- Signals reversal to downside

**W Pattern** (Bottom/Bullish Reversal):
- Forms at the low of a move
- Created by stop hunts below support
- Traps sellers
- Signals reversal to upside

## Top-Down Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Higher Timeframe Context (Weekly/Daily)

#### Weekly Analysis

1. **Identify Weekly Quarterly Phase**
   - Where are we in the weekly A-M-D-X cycle?
   - Monday = Q1 (Accumulation/Consolidation)
   - Tuesday = Q2 (Manipulation - True Week Open)
   - Wednesday = Q3 (Distribution - Best trading day)
   - Thursday = Q4 (Reversal/Continuation)
   - Friday = Special function (often reversal or balance)

2. **BTMM 3-Day Cycle Position**
   - Is this Day 1 (initial move/PF creation)?
   - Is this Day 2 (accumulation against PF)?
   - Is this Day 3 (distribution/reversal)?

3. **Identify Peak Formation (PF)**
   - Weekly high = PF High (expect move down)
   - Weekly low = PF Low (expect move up)
   - PF typically established Monday-Tuesday

4. **Mark Weekly PSR (Psychological Support/Resistance)**
   - First 8 H1 candles of the week = PSR zone
   - This is the accumulation/trap zone

#### Daily Analysis

1. **Identify Daily Quarterly Phase**
   - Q1 (6pm-12am): Asian Session - Accumulation
   - Q2 (12am-6am): London Session - Manipulation (True Day Open = 12am)
   - Q3 (6am-12pm): NY AM Session - Distribution
   - Q4 (12pm-6pm): NY PM Session - Reversal/Continuation

2. **Previous Day HOD/LOD**
   - Mark these as key levels
   - Expect manipulation around these points

3. **Daily Bias**
   - Is price above or below True Day Open (midnight)?
   - Above = bullish bias (look for longs below it)
   - Below = bearish bias (look for shorts above it)

4. **Asian Range Analysis**
   - Tight range (8pm-12am) = Expect strong London/NY
   - Extended range = Expect quieter London/NY, possible range-bound day
   - Asian range acts as accumulation zone

### Step 2: Session Analysis (4H/1H)

#### London Session (1:30 AM - 6:00 AM EST)

1. **True Session Open = 1:30 AM**
   - Key reference point for manipulation
   - Expect price to sweep above/below this level

2. **Stop Hunt Phase (1:00-4:00 AM)**
   - Look for break of Asian range
   - "3 swipes" pattern
   - Creates HOD or LOD
   - 30-90 minute re-accumulation after

3. **Session Quarterly Breakdown**
   - Q1 (12:00am - 1:30am): Pre-manipulation
   - Q2 (1:30am - 3:00am): Manipulation begins (True Open)
   - Q3 (3:00am - 4:30am): Direction becoming clear
   - Q4 (4:30am - 6:00am): Continuation or handoff to NY

#### New York Session (7:30 AM - 12:00 PM EST)

1. **True Session Open = 7:30 AM**
   - Another key manipulation point
   - Often reverses London move or continues it

2. **Distribution Phase**
   - This is where the REAL move happens
   - 6-8 hour trend
   - Highest probability trades

3. **Session Quarterly Breakdown**
   - Q1 (6:00am - 7:30am): Pre-open positioning
   - Q2 (7:30am - 9:00am): Manipulation (True NY Open)
   - Q3 (9:00am - 10:30am): Distribution begins
   - Q4 (10:30am - 12:00pm): Trend continuation

4. **Look for M or W Completion**
   - If London made high (M pattern forming), NY distributes down
   - If London made low (W pattern forming), NY distributes up

### Step 3: Intraday Execution (15M/5M/1M)

#### 90-Minute Quarters (Critical for Entries)

Each 6-hour session breaks into 4 x 90-minute quarters:

**Example - NY AM Session (6:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**:
- Q1: 6:00am - 7:30am (Accumulation)
- Q2: 7:30am - 9:00am (Manipulation - **True Open**)
- Q3: 9:00am - 10:30am (Distribution - **Best entries**)
- Q4: 10:30am - 12:00pm (Continuation)

**Trading Rule**: 
- Wait for Q2 manipulation to complete
- Enter in Q3 when distribution begins
- Best Risk/Reward in early Q3

#### Micro Quarters (22.5 Minutes) - Optional for Scalpers

Example for first 90-min quarter (6:00-7:30 AM):
- Q1: 6:00 - 6:22:30
- Q2: 6:22:30 - 6:45 (Micro True Open)
- Q3: 6:45 - 7:07:30 (Micro distribution)
- Q4: 7:07:30 - 7:30

## Daily Trading Routine

### Pre-Market Analysis (30 minutes before session)

#### 1. Weekly Context Check (5 min)
- [ ] What day of the week? (Which weekly quarter?)
- [ ] Where is Weekly PF High/Low?
- [ ] What's the weekly PSR zone?
- [ ] Are we in 3-day cycle Day 1, 2, or 3?

#### 2. Daily Context Check (10 min)
- [ ] Mark True Day Open (midnight price)
- [ ] Mark previous day HOD/LOD
- [ ] Identify Asian Range (8pm-12am)
- [ ] Is Asian range tight or extended?

- Identify where volume is building
- Don't trade yet - let manipulation happen
- Mark the stop hunt/Judas Swing

#### Phase 2: Confirmation (After manipulation)
- Wait for clear break of True Open
- Identify M or W pattern formation
- Look for rejection candles (hammers, shooting stars)
- Wait for 30-90 min re-accumulation after stop hunt

#### Phase 3: Execution (Q3 Distribution)
- Enter when Q3 begins after Q2 manipulation
- Enter in direction OPPOSITE to the stop hunt
- Use True Opens as entry reference
- Target previous day's opposite extreme

### Post-Market Review (15 minutes)

- [ ] Did the A-M-D-X cycle play out as expected?
- [ ] Where did the stop hunt occur?
- [ ] Did I enter during Q3 distribution?
- [ ] Was my entry relative to True Open correct?
- [ ] Journal wins and losses
- [ ] Identify pattern for tomorrow's PF

## Entry & Exit Strategies

### Entry Rules

#### Primary Setup: Post-Manipulation Entry (Highest Probability)

**Bullish Entry Requirements**:
1. Price creates W pattern (low of day/session)
2. Stop hunt occurs BELOW True Open
3. We are in Q2 (manipulation quarter) or early Q3
4. Price rejects back ABOVE True Open
5. Reversal candlestick pattern (hammer, bullish engulfing)
6. Enter BELOW the True Open after rejection
7. 30-90 min re-accumulation after stop hunt completed

**Bearish Entry Requirements**:
1. Price creates M pattern (high of day/session)
2. Stop hunt occurs ABOVE True Open
3. We are in Q2 (manipulation quarter) or early Q3
4. Price rejects back BELOW True Open
5. Reversal candlestick pattern (shooting star, bearish engulfing)
6. Enter ABOVE the True Open after rejection
7. 30-90 min re-accumulation after stop hunt completed

#### Secondary Setup: Q3 Distribution Continuation

**For Longs**:
- W pattern already confirmed
- Currently in Q3 of any timeframe
- Price pulls back to True Open level
- Enter on bounce from True Open
- Trend clearly established to upside

**For Shorts**:
- M pattern already confirmed
- Currently in Q3 of any timeframe
- Price retraces to True Open level
- Enter on rejection from True Open
- Trend clearly established to downside

### Stop Loss Placement

**Tight Stops** (Intraday):
- Just beyond the manipulation swing
- 5-20 pips beyond the M or W extreme
- Behind the stop hunt candle wick

**Medium Stops** (Swing):
- Beyond the session True Open (opposite side)
- Beyond the daily quarter boundary
- 20-50 pips

**Wider Stops** (Position):
- Beyond weekly PF
- Beyond previous week's high/low
- 50-100+ pips

### Take Profit Targets

**Target 1** (Conservative - 1:2 RR):
- Previous session opposite extreme
- Daily quarter boundary
- 50% of daily range

**Target 2** (Standard - 1:3 RR):
- Previous day HOD/LOD
- Full daily range
- Weekly quarter boundary

**Target 3** (Extended - 1:5+ RR):
- Weekly PF opposite extreme
- Previous week high/low
- Major support/resistance levels

**Scaling Out Strategy**:
- Take 1/3 at Target 1
- Take 1/3 at Target 2
- Let 1/3 run with trailing stop to Target 3

### Trailing Stop Strategy

1. **After TP1 hit**: Move stop to breakeven
2. **After TP2 hit**: Trail stop to Target 1 level
3. **In profit 2:1+**: Trail by quarter boundaries (90-min, session, daily)
4. **Multi-day runners**: Trail by True Opens of higher timeframes

---

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing Rules

1. **Never risk more than 1-2% per trade**
2. **Scale position size based on stop distance**:
   - Tight stop (10-20 pips) = Larger size
   - Wide stop (50+ pips) = Smaller size
3. **Maximum 3 open positions across different timeframes**
4. **Reduce size during low probability setups**

### Trade Frequency Guidelines

#### High Probability Times (Trade More Aggressively):
- Wednesday (Weekly Q3) - Best day
- NY Session Q3 (9:00-10:30 AM EST)
- After clear stop hunt + 30-90 min re-accumulation
- Day 3 of BTMM cycle
- When weekly and daily quarters align

#### Lower Probability Times (Trade Conservatively or Avoid):
- Fridays (unless clear setup)
- Monday Q1 (too much accumulation)
- During Asian range (unless scalping)
- Day 1 of new BTMM cycle
- When quarters conflict across timeframes

### Daily/Weekly Loss Limits

- **Daily Stop**: 2-3% of account
- **Weekly Stop**: 5-6% of account
- **If daily limit hit**: Stop trading for the day
- **If weekly limit hit**: Stop trading for the week
- **Revenge trading = Account killer**

### Psychological Rules

1. **Never chase price after missing entry**
2. **Wait for next quarterly cycle**
3. **Quality over quantity** - fewer, better trades
4. **Trust the cycle** - it repeats daily
5. **Market makers WILL manipulate** - expect it and profit from it

## Advanced Concepts

### Multi-Timeframe Quarterly Alignment

**Highest Probability Trades** occur when multiple timeframes align:

**Example - Perfect Storm Long Setup**:
- **Weekly**: Q3 (Wednesday) - Distribution phase up
- **Daily**: Q3 (6am-12pm NY) - Distribution phase up
- **Session**: NY Q3 (9:00-10:30am) - Distribution up
- **90-Min**: Q3 of NY AM - Distribution up
- **Result**: 4 timeframes in distribution quarter = Maximum conviction

**How to Identify**:
1. Start with weekly - where are we?
2. Zoom to daily - does it align?
3. Zoom to session - does it align?
4. If 3+ align = High probability setup
5. If they conflict = Wait or reduce size

### The "Wednesday Power Move"

**Why Wednesday is Special**:
- Weekly Q3 (Distribution quarter)
- 3-Day cycle often completes Tuesday-Wednesday
- Manipulation complete by Wednesday AM
- Cleanest, strongest trends

**How to Trade Wednesday**:
1. By Wednesday, weekly PF established (Mon/Tue)
2. Look for reversal setups Tuesday evening/Wednesday AM
3. Wednesday sessions have extended ranges
4. Hold trades longer - targets further
5. Best day to swing trade into Thursday

### The Friday Phenomenon

**Friday Characteristics**:
- Not part of standard weekly quarters (special function)
- Often consolidates or reverses weekly move
- Market makers "balance the books"
- Lower volume, whippy price action
- Profit-taking day

**Friday Trading Rules**:
1. **Avoid** unless setup is crystal clear
2. Take profits from earlier week trades
3. Don't hold positions over weekend without wide stops
4. If trading: scalp only, tight stops
5. Respect that manipulation is less predictable

### Correlation Trading

**When to Use**:
- Trade multiple correlated pairs for confirmation
- Example: EUR/USD and GBP/USD often move together

**Correlation Strategy**:
1. Identify manipulation on EUR/USD
2. Check if GBP/USD shows same pattern
3. If both align = Higher confidence
4. Enter both if size permits (reduce per-trade risk)
5. Or choose the cleaner setup

### The "Ghost Town" Pacific Session

**5:00 PM - 8:00 PM EST** (After NY close, before Asia):
- Lowest liquidity
- Price often meanders
- Not ideal for trading
- Can observe accumulation beginning

**Use This Time**:
- Prepare for next trading day
- Review charts
- Set alerts
- Mark key levels
- Study previous day's action

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Entering During Q1 Accumulation
**Problem**: Too early, price is ranging, no trend
**Solution**: Wait for Q2 to complete, enter in Q3

### Mistake 2: Ignoring True Opens
**Problem**: Entering without reference to manipulation zones
**Solution**: Always mark True Opens, base entries around them

### Mistake 3: Chasing After Missing Entry
**Problem**: FOMO leads to poor entry, often tops/bottoms
**Solution**: Wait 90 minutes, next quarter will provide setup

### Mistake 4: Fighting the 3-Day Cycle
**Problem**: Going long on Day 1 of bearish 3-day cycle
**Solution**: Identify PF early, trade WITH the cycle direction

### Mistake 5: Trading Friday Like Wednesday
**Problem**: Friday is unpredictable, different dynamics
**Solution**: Reduce size or avoid, take profits instead

### Mistake 6: Oversized Positions
**Problem**: One loss wipes out multiple wins
**Solution**: Strict 1-2% risk per trade, no exceptions

### Mistake 7: No Stop Loss or Moving Stops Wider
**Problem**: Small loss becomes account-killer
**Solution**: Set stop before entry, never move it wider

### Mistake 8: Ignoring Higher Timeframe Context
**Problem**: Great 15M setup, but daily is opposite direction
**Solution**: Always check higher timeframes first

### Mistake 9: Trading Asian Range (Unless Scalping)
**Problem**: Choppy, low-conviction, accumulation phase
**Solution**: Wait for London manipulation or NY distribution

### Mistake 10: Revenge Trading After Loss
**Problem**: Emotional, undisciplined entries
**Solution**: Daily loss limit, walk away, reset next day

## Sample Trade Examples

### Example 1: EUR/USD Wednesday London-NY Reversal

**Context** (Wednesday, November 15):
- Weekly: Q3 (Distribution week)
- Daily: Q2-Q3 transition (London-NY)
- BTMM: Day 3 of cycle

**Setup**:
- Asian Session (Q1): Tight range 1.0850-1.0860
- London Open (Q2 begins): Price spikes to 1.0895 (manipulation up)
- True London Open (1:30am): 1.0865
- Stop hunt ABOVE True Open = Bearish bias
- M Pattern forming on 15M chart

**Entry** (9:15 AM EST, NY Q3):
- Price rejected back below 1.0865
- Bearish engulfing on 15M
- 8 EMA crossed below 21 EMA
- TDI showing bearish shark fin
- **ENTRY SHORT**: 1.0862
- **STOP**: 1.0898 (above manipulation high)
- **TP1**: 1.0830 (previous day low)
- **TP2**: 1.0800 (weekly support)
- **TP3**: 1.0770 (monthly level)

**Outcome**:
- TP1 hit 11:30 AM (took 1/3 off, +32 pips)
- TP2 hit 2:45 PM (took 1/3 off, +62 pips)
- TP3 hit next day (final 1/3, +92 pips)
- Average exit: ~62 pips
- Risk/Reward: 1:5.8
- Held through perfect Q3 distribution

**Key Lessons**:
- Wednesday Q3 = High probability
- Waited for full manipulation before entry
- M pattern + True Open rejection = Strong setup
- Scaled out appropriately
- NY session delivered 6+ hour trend

### Example 2: GBP/USD Friday Avoided (Discipline)

**Context** (Friday, November 17):
- Weekly: Q4 (Reversal/Continuation)
- Daily: Q2 (London session)
- BTMM: Post-cycle consolidation

**Attempted Setup**:
- Asian range tight: 1.2450-1.2465
- London pumps to 1.2520 (looks like M pattern)
- Price drops back to 1.2470

**Why NO TRADE**:
- It's Friday (special function day)
- Weekly Q4 = unpredictable
- Previous 3-day cycle already completed Wednesday-Thursday
- EMAs tangled (consolidation mode)
- Low conviction

**Action Taken**:
- Closed Wednesday short from Example 1 for profit
- Sat on hands
- Prepared analysis for Monday
- Avoided choppy 80-pip whipsaw that followed

**Key Lessons**:
- Not every setup should be traded
- Friday is different
- Protecting profits > forcing trades
- Discipline = Longevity

### Example 3: USD/JPY 3-Day Swing Trade

**Context** (Monday-Wednesday):
- Weekly: Q1-Q2-Q3 (Full cycle ahead)
- BTMM: Beginning of 3-day cycle

**Day 1 (Monday) - Observation**:
- NY session pumps USD/JPY from 149.50 to 150.30
- PF High established at 150.30
- Retail traders likely long
- **NO TRADE** - Just marking PF

**Day 2 (Tuesday) - Accumulation**:
- Price consolidates 149.90-150.20
- Another small push to 150.35 (new PF High)
- True Week Open (Tuesday midnight): 149.95
- More longs trapped
- **NO TRADE** - Waiting for Day 3

**Day 3 (Wednesday) - Distribution**:
- **ENTRY** Wednesday 8:00 AM (NY session Q2):
- Price gaps down to 149.85
- Breaks below True Week Open
- M pattern confirmed over 3 days
- **SHORT** 149.80
- **STOP**: 150.40 (above PF High)
- **TP1**: 149.00 (weekly support)
- **TP2**: 148.40 (monthly level)

**Outcome**:
- TP1 hit Thursday morning (+80 pips, took 50%)
- TP2 hit Friday morning (+140 pips, final 50%)
- Average exit: 110 pips
- Risk: 60 pips
- Risk/Reward: 1:3.7
- Held 2.5 days (swing trade)

**Key Lessons**:
- Patience to wait 3 days for setup
- PF identification on Day 1 crucial
- Day 3 distribution = highest probability
- Wider stops for swing trades acceptable
- Weekly context + BTMM cycle = Power combo

## Conclusion: Mastering the Combined Method

### The Power of Integration

By combining Quarterly Theory and BTMM, you gain:

1. **Precision Timing** (Quarterly Theory)
   - Know exactly which quarter you're in
   - Time entries to Q3 distribution phase
   - Use True Opens as manipulation reference

2. **Market Psychology** (BTMM)
   - Understand market maker intentions
   - Recognize the 3-day accumulation-distribution cycle
   - Identify stop hunts and reversals

3. **Multi-Timeframe Edge**
   - Fractal analysis from yearly to micro quarters
   - Align multiple timeframes for conviction
   - Scale trades based on timeframe alignment

### The Path to Consistency

**Month 1-2**: Education & Observation
- Study both methodologies thoroughly
- Mark True Opens and quarters on charts daily
- Paper trade only
- Journal observations without money at risk

**Month 3-4**: Simulation Trading
- Demo account with real-time execution
- Follow all rules strictly
- Journal every trade
- Minimum 50 trades before live money

**Month 5-6**: Live Trading (Small Size)
- Start with minimum position sizes
- 1% risk maximum (or even 0.5%)
- Build confidence and track record
- Focus on process, not profits

**Month 7+**: Scaling Up
- Gradually increase size as consistency improves
- Aim for 60%+ win rate with 1:3 RR
- Monthly profitability = Scale up
- Monthly loss = Reduce size and review

### Final Thoughts

The market operates in cycles. Market makers manipulate price to accumulate positions. They always need:
1. **Time** to accumulate (Q1)
2. **Manipulation** to trap traders (Q2)
3. **Distribution** to profit (Q3)
4. **Reversal** to reset (Q4)

This happens every 22.5 minutes, every 90 minutes, every session, every day, every week, every month, every quarter, every year.

**Your edge is knowing this.** 

**Your profit is timing it.**

**Your success is executing it.**

Trade with discipline. Trust the process. Follow the institutions.
