## 🔄 WHY TOP-DOWN?

### Makes Logical Sense:
- **Start BIG** (weekly) → **End SMALL** (micro)
- **Time first** → **Execution second** → **Protection third**
- **Context** (where are we in the cycle?) → **Action** (what do I do?)

### Matches Trading Reality:
1. Check the **week** - Is it Monday (observe) or Wednesday (trade)?
2. Check the **day** - What session are we in?
3. Check the **pattern** - Is it M or W?
4. **Execute** - Enter the trade
5. **Protect** - Manage risk

### Easier to Learn:
- Understand the "big picture" first
- Drill down to details
- Build knowledge progressively
- Less overwhelming for beginners
