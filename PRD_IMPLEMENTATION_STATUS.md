### 5. Cursor AI Integration

**What's Implemented:**
- ✅ JSON export includes AI-friendly metadata

**What's NOT Possible (Technical Limitations):**
- ❌ Direct Cursor API integration (no public API exists)

**Workaround for AI Analysis:**
1. Export JSON
2. Open file
3. Paste into Cursor chat with prompt:
   ```
   Analyze my trading journal data and tell me:
   - Why did I lose on Thursday?
   - What patterns lead to my best trades?
   - Psychological insights from my notes
   ```

**Status:** Manual workflow implemented (no automated API integration possible)

---

- [ ] Replace `window.print()` with html2pdf.js
- [ ] Branded layout with logo
- [ ] Include equity curve charts
- [ ] Professional formatting

**Priority:** Medium (current print works, but not ideal)

---

### 7. Cloud Sync
- [ ] iCloud Drive integration
- [ ] Google Drive sync
- [ ] Cross-device sync

**Priority:** Low (for future release)

---

### 8. Auto-Pruning
- [ ] Auto-delete trades > 1 year old
- [ ] localStorage management

**Priority:** Low (not critical for current usage)

### For Trade Analysis:
```
[Paste JSON export]

Question: Why did I lose on Thursday?

Context: Look at all Thursday trades, their notes, patterns, and timing.
```

### For Psychology Insights:
```
[Paste JSON export]

Analyze my trading psychology based on my notes. Identify:
1. Anxiety triggers
2. Best mental states
3. Pattern between emotions and P/L
```

### For Pattern Recognition:
```
[Paste JSON export]

Which setups have the highest win rate? 
What time of day am I most profitable?
```

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS (vs PRD Goals)

| Goal | Target | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Auto-fill weekly review | 100% | ✅ 100% |
| Calendar render | Works | ✅ Works |
| Cursor AI integration | Real-time | ⚠️ Manual workflow (API not available) |
| Export functionality | JSON | ✅ Complete |
| Data persistence | Local + Cloud | ✅ Local (Cloud v2.1) |

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Cursor Integration:** No runtime API exists for web apps to directly call Cursor AI. Best approach is structured JSON export for manual analysis.

2. **localStorage:** Sufficient for current needs. Cloud sync can be added later if needed.

3. **Auto-Population:** Works perfectly! Pulling from logged trades is seamless.

4. **Calendar Fix:** Issue was grid rendering logic. Fixed with proper 6×7 calculation and empty cell handling.

---

## 🚦 NEXT STEPS (Post-MVP)

### v2.1 Features (Optional):
1. Better PDF export with html2pdf.js
2. Cloud sync (iCloud/Google Drive)
3. Auto-prune old trades
4. Trade screenshots upload
5. Chart.js equity curve

### For David:
- ✅ Start using "Load from Journal" for weekly reviews
- ✅ Export JSON weekly for AI analysis with Cursor
- ✅ Test calendar navigation
- ✅ Backup data monthly

---
