12pm-6pm  | NY PM    | Q4 | Reversal      | Continuation/Exit trades
```

## WEEKLY TRADING SCHEDULE
- **MONDAY** (Q1): Accumulation - Mark PF High/Low - TRADE LIGHT

- **WEDNESDAY** (Q3): Distribution - **BEST TRADING DAY** 🔥
- **THURSDAY** (Q4): Continuation - Trade pullbacks in trend
- **FRIDAY**: Special - Take profits, AVOID new trades

## BTMM 3-DAY CYCLE
**Day 1**: PF established (high or low) - Retail trapped
**Day 2**: Accumulation continues - More volume trapped  
**Day 3**: DISTRIBUTION & REVERSAL - Enter against PF ✓

## ENTRY RULES

### BULLISH SETUP (W Pattern)
1. Stop hunt **BELOW** True Open ✓
2. Price rejects back **ABOVE** True Open ✓
3. Currently in Q2/Q3 ✓
4. Hammer/Bullish engulfing candle ✓
5. **ENTER LONG** below True Open after rejection

### BEARISH SETUP (M Pattern)
1. Stop hunt **ABOVE** True Open ✓
2. Price rejects back **BELOW** True Open ✓
3. Currently in Q2/Q3 ✓
4. Shooting Star/Bearish engulfing ✓
5. **ENTER SHORT** above True Open after rejection

## 30-SECOND PRE-TRADE CHECKLIST
- [ ] What quarter am I in? (Must be Q2 ending or Q3)
- [ ] Where is True Open? (Price positioned correctly vs it?)
- [ ] M or W pattern complete? (Stop hunt occurred?)
- [ ] 30-90 min re-accumulation done? (If intraday)
- [ ] Stop loss = 1-2% risk max? (RR minimum 1:2?)

**ALL YES = ENTER | ANY NO = WAIT**

## STOP LOSS & TARGETS

### Stops
- **Tight**: 5-20 pips beyond M/W extreme
- **Medium**: Beyond True Open opposite side (20-50 pips)
- **Wide**: Beyond weekly PF (50-100+ pips)

### Targets
- **TP1** (1:2): Previous session opposite extreme
- **TP2** (1:3): Previous day HOD/LOD  
- **TP3** (1:5): Weekly PF opposite side

**Scale Out**: 1/3 at each target, trail final 1/3

## BEST TRADING TIMES (High Probability)
⭐ **Wednesday 9:00-10:30 AM EST** (Weekly Q3 + Daily Q3 + Session Q3)
⭐ **Tuesday-Thursday NY Session Q3** (9:00-10:30 AM EST)
⭐ **Day 3 of BTMM Cycle** (Whenever distribution occurs)
⭐ **After clear London stop hunt** (1:30-4:00 AM) → NY Entry (9:00 AM)

## AVOID TRADING (Low Probability)
❌ **Mondays** (Q1 accumulation, too choppy)
❌ **Fridays** (Special function, unpredictable)
❌ **Asian Session** (Unless scalping range)
❌ **During Q1** (Any timeframe - accumulation only)
❌ **Before stop hunt occurs** (Too early = trapped)

## RISK MANAGEMENT RULES
1. **Max 1-2% risk per trade** (No exceptions!)
2. **Max 3 open positions** (Across all pairs)
3. **Daily loss limit: 2-3%** (Stop trading if hit)
4. **Weekly loss limit: 5-6%** (Take week off if hit)
5. **Win rate target: 60%+** with 1:3 RR = Profitable

## THE 10 COMMANDMENTS
1. Mark all True Opens daily
2. Wait for Q2 manipulation to complete
3. Enter in Q3 distribution only
4. Respect the 3-day BTMM cycle
5. Entry position vs True Open is critical
6. Never chase missed trades
7. Risk only 1-2% per trade
8. Journal every single trade
9. Honor your stops always
10. Trust the cycle - it repeats daily

## PATTERN RECOGNITION

### M-Top (Bearish)
```
    M   ← Stop hunt ABOVE True Open
   / \
  /   \  ← Rejection
 /     ↓ ← ENTER SHORT
```

### W-Bottom (Bullish)
```
       ↑ ← ENTER LONG
  ↑   / ← Rejection  
   \ /
    W   ← Stop hunt BELOW True Open
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
- ⚠️ Entering during Q1 accumulation (too early)
- ⚠️ Ignoring True Opens (no reference point)
- ⚠️ Chasing price after missing entry (FOMO)
- ⚠️ Trading against 3-day cycle direction
- ⚠️ Friday trading (just don't)
- ⚠️ Oversized positions (greed kills accounts)
- ⚠️ Moving stops wider (discipline = success)
- ⚠️ Revenge trading after losses (emotional death)

## WHEN MULTIPLE TIMEFRAMES ALIGN = 🚀

**Example Perfect Setup**:
- Weekly: Q3 (Wednesday)
- Daily: Q3 (NY Session)  
- Session: Q3 (9:00-10:30 AM)
- 90-Min: Q3
= **HIGHEST CONVICTION TRADE**

## QUICK MATH
**Win Rate**: 60% | **RR**: 1:3 | **Risk**: 1% per trade
- 10 trades: 6 wins (+18%) + 4 losses (-4%) = **+14% gain**
- 20 trades: 12 wins (+36%) + 8 losses (-8%) = **+28% gain**

**Consistency beats home runs!**
