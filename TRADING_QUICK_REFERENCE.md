| **LQ Progress** | 0-100% completion | Red <33%, Yellow 34-66%, Green >67% |
| **SQ Completed** | X/10 count | Momentum gauge (each = 25 PIPs) |
| **Position** | HZ / Half / LQ / Quarter | Tells you where price is in cycle |
| **3-Day Rule** | Day X/3 or Inactive | CRITICAL for timing |
| **144-Day** | X/144 or Reversal Zone | Gann timing factor |

## 💰 POSITION SIZING

**Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk%) / (Stop PIPs × PIP Value)
```

**Example:**
```
Account: $50,000
Risk: 1% = $500
Stop: 40 PIPs
PIP Value: $10/PIP/lot (EUR/USD)

Position = $500 / (40 × $10) = 1.25 lots
```

**Risk by Confluence:**
- 3-4 pts: Risk 0.5-1.0%
- 5-6 pts: Risk 1.0-1.5%
- 7+ pts: Risk 1.5-2.5%

**MAX RISK:** Never exceed 2.5% per trade or 5% total open risk.
