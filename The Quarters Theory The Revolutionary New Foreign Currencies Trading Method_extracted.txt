Preface
Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? I haven’t always
been a strong proponent of this theory, but looking back at certain
events in my life has made me a believer.
I was introduced to the “forbidden” world of foreign currency ex-
change in communist Bulgaria at the tender age of eight, when in 1979 myfather was arrested by the communist militia because of his involvement
in a black market currency exchange. My family was told that my fatherowned and dealt with those “evil” U.S. dollars, British pounds, German
marks, and other foreign currencies that the “capitalist pigs” use to buy
their “rotten” goods and services “produced with the blood, sweat, andtears of the proletariat.” It was a true baptism by ﬁre. To prove that the
apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as a high school and a college student, I
made money soliciting currency exchange from foreign tourists and foreign
exchange students, and exchanged currencies on Magura Street (commu-
nist Bulgaria’s black market version of Wall Street). Is it any wonder that Iturned out to be a currency trader?
My life’s experiences have taught and continue to teach me some valu-
able lessons that I apply in my trading. But as a trader, I will admit thatnothing educates and disciplines better than the most devastating loss that
a trader can ever experience in his or her career. I’m not talking about the
periods when you hit the wall after you’ve been on a roll and are feeling in-vincible. One can learn to get over those fairly quickly. What I’m referring
to is the big one, the tsunami that shatters many months of hard work and
consistent proﬁts with a violent blow that lasts only a few minutes.
My big one was planned to be exactly that—big. However, it was
supposed to be a winning big one. This was to be the one that takes a
trader into the stratosphere of trading greatness, delivering a life-changing
1000+% return. So, as Jesse Livermore would have said, I “took the plunge.”
I’d had a great sequence of several big winning months before and I felt
that I was bulletproof—exactly the right mixture of self-conﬁdence and ar-
rogance that was enough to blur the lines between a trade and a gamble,
and to make me throw almost my entire account at this trade. All went

xii PREFACE
out of the U.S. dollar and all went in Euros and Swiss francs as soon as
Colin Powell made the case for the war in Iraq to the United Nations. My
conceited mind was so certain about the success of this trade—after all,
it’s been historically proven over the past 200 years that when the UnitedStates goes to war, the U.S. dollar goes down. My ego had blindsided me
so much that I didn’t even bother placing any stops to protect myself. After
all, why would I need any protection if I was invincible?
You’ve probably already ﬁgured out how this story ends. The tsunami
of hundreds of PIPs against me right after the war announcement wasenough to make me spend the rest of the day picking up the pieces ofwhat was left of my trading account and licking the wounds of my trau-
matized trader’s psyche. It was a devastating experience, but I am grateful
that it happened to me, because in the days and months of soul searchingthat followed, I became a born-again trader with a revived mindset and a
completely new trading method.
This is how The Quarters Theory was born. It was a result of my rigor-
ous process of recovery from the turmoil that I had inﬂicted on my tradingaccount and on myself. Whether I wanted it or not, I was taken back to
Square One. From that point, there was no other way to go but back to the
basics, rebuilding from the ground up. And what better way to get back to
the basics than focusing on the most basic unit of information for everytrader—the price? I had to get away from the clutter of charts and techni-
cal indicators, and be absent from the never-ending hunt for volatility and
the scalping stampedes during news events.
The Quarters Theory was my solution to the need I had for that extra
edge through an unprecedented, innovative methodology based on a freshnew approach and a deeper perception of price behavior in the daily ﬂuctu-ations of currency exchange rates. I discovered during my period of trader
revelation how to distinguish myself from the herd. I have strived for and
I have found a simple, yet effective, unique, yet not abstract method thatserves as a reliable compass to navigate me through the high waters of mar-
ket volatility and uncertainty. With The Quarters Theory, I have created an
orderly, familiar, systematic, predictable environment and trading method-ology that allows traders to break free from the dogma of chaos and the
perceptions of market randomness.
I ﬁrst introduced The Quarters Theory to a large audience of traders in
2005 when I was invited as one of the FX strategists of a new startup ﬁnan-
cial network called Traders Television. In the following months, I was alsoasked to host the advanced Forex training program of “Trader Talk Live,”
an Internet broadcast focused on trader education. I knew from personal
experience that The Quarters Theory is immensely helpful, but I will admitthat even in my wildest dreams I did not expect the type of overwhelm-
ing response that I received when I started sharing my method with other

currency traders. My audience grew, the word of mouth was spreading, and
it was only a few short months before the unsolicited testimonials from
traders, whose trading results had improved dramatically as a result of my
teachings, began ﬁlling my e-mail box. It was ofﬁcial: The Quarters Theorywas helping and I was humbled and happy to be able to make a difference
for thousands of traders.
In recent years, interest in The Quarters Theory has continued to grow
as a result of my appearances as a speaker at educational seminars and we-binars, through my weekly publications and columns on popular ﬁnancial
websites, as well as through my daily “All Things Forex” broadcast and mywebsite www.allthingsforex.com.
I hope that you will enjoy what you are about to discover in this book
and that you ﬁnd The Quarters Theory to be a meaningful and substantial
way to improve your methods of trading currencies on the Forex market
and to experience consistently better trading results.

CHAPTER 1
The Foundation
of The Quarters
Theory
Price is the most basic and most important unit of information avail-
able to a trader. Price represents the monetary value assigned togoods, services, and assets. In the ﬁnancial markets, price is the nu-
merical monetary value of equities, commodities, currencies, and other ﬁ-nancial assets, determined as a result of an exchange or trade transactionbetween market participants. Price is measured by numbers grouped as
mathematical objects in a numeral system.
Most countries in the world, with the exception of two, Mauritania and
Madagascar, use the decimal numeral system. The decimal system is a po-
sitional numeral system; it has positions for units, tens, hundreds, and so
forth. The reason for the choice of tenas the unit is assumed to be because
humans have ten ﬁngers (digits). In many languages the word digit or its
translation is also the anatomical term referring to ﬁngers and toes. In En-
glish, decimal (Lat. decimus) means “tenth,” decimate means “reduce by a
tenth,” and denary (Lat. denarius) means the “unit of ten.”
The writing of numbers in the base-ten numeral system is known as
decimal notation and uses various symbols, called digits , for ten distinct
values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to represent numbers. The most universallyused numbers are the whole numbers as part of the real numbers. The realnumbers include:
Whole numbers ( 0 ,1 ,2 ,3 , ...)
Natural (counting) numbers (1, 2, 3, ...)
Integers (..., –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, ...)
Rational numbers (any integer divided by any non-zero integer)
Irrational numbers (any real number that is not rational)

Every counting number is also a whole number; every whole number
is also an integer; and every integer is also a rational number. The whole
numbers include the number 0 and all of the counting numbers. Because
the decimal system is a base-ten numeral system, a value of 10 in one posi-tion is equal to a value of 1 in the position to the left. For example, ten ones
equal one ten, ten tens equal 100, ten 100s equal 1000, and so forth. Let us
glance through the table of whole numbers in Table 1.1.
Have you noticed the ﬁrst number in each row? The number 10 is the
base and we know that the ﬁrst number in each row of this table (except forthe number 0) can be represented as a set of ten. The ﬁrst number in each
row of the table of whole numbers represents a critical junction that marks
the end of a previous set and, at the same time, the beginning of a new setof ten numbers. For example, the number 10 marks the end of the set of
ten single digits and the beginning of a new set of ten double-digit numbers
known as the teens; the number 20 marks the end of the teens set and the
beginning of the twenties; and so forth. Because of their signiﬁcance, The
Quarters Theory gives the name Major Whole Numbers to the ﬁrst numbers
in each row of the table of whole numbers.
Currency exchange rates are determined by comparing the numerical
monetary value of one currency against another measured in whole num-bers. Currencies are grouped in pairs: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, andso forth. The ﬁrst listed currency of a currency pair is the base currency,
or the unit that is compared to the second quote currency used to assess
the value of the base currency. The precision needed to represent currencyexchange rates requires the use of decimal whole numbers. These digits
have a decimal point that indicates the start of a fractional part (1.1, 1.2,
1.3, etc.). Digits are placed to the left and right of a decimal point in orderto indicate a number less than or greater than 1. For example, an exchange
rate of $1.35 for the EUR against the USD (EUR/USD) indicates that the

--- PAGE 21 ---

P1: SBT
c01 JWBT192-Yotov October 8, 2009 21:28 Printer: Yet to come
The Foundation of The Quarters Theory 3
value of one Euro unit is greater than one U.S. dollar. On the other hand,
an exchange rate of $0.70 for the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar
(AUD/USD) shows that the value of one Australian dollar unit is less than
one U.S. dollar.
The Major Whole Numbers can be easily distinguished in currency
exchange rates even with the decimal point numeral representation. TheQuarters Theory considers the parity level of one-for-one exchange rate as
thebenchmark Major Whole Number in currency exchange rates. The Ma-
jor Whole Number 1.0000 represents the par value between two currencies.For example, an exchange rate of exactly $1.0000 for the EUR/USD pair in-
dicates a parity value of $1 for one Euro. If the EUR increases in value
by ten cents against the USD, the EUR/USD exchange rate will exceed thepar level and will reach another Major Whole Number at $1.1000. Addi-
tional 10-cent increase above $1.1000 will see the EUR/USD exchange rate
reaching another Major Whole Number at $1.2000. Every one of the MajorWhole Numbers in currency exchange rates represents a critical junction
that marks the end of a previous set and, at the same time, the beginning
of a new set of ten numbers. For example, if the EUR/USD pair’s exchangerate reaches $1.2000, the Major Whole Number 1.2000 would mark the end
of the set of ten numbers: 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 ...1.19 (or the dollar teens) and
the beginning of a new set of ten numbers: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22 ...1.29 (or the
dollar twenties ).
Currency decimalization has caused traditional denominations of cur-
rencies to be converted to the decimal system. Through the process of cur-rency decimalization, one unit of the main currency is usually divided into
100 subunits. For example, 1 dollar and 1 Euro are divided into 100 cents,1 pound into 100 pence, 1 franc into 100 centimes, and so forth. For even
more precision, currency exchange rates are decimalized even further by
dividing the subunits (1 cent, 1 penny, 1 centime) or the main unit of somecurrencies (e.g. 1 yen) into 100 additional subunits, called Price Interest
Points (PIPs). A PIP is the smallest unit of price for any foreign currency
(e.g., for EUR/USD one PIP—Price Interest Point—equals .0001 U.S. dol-lar). Whether the subunit is 1 cent, 1 penny, 1 centime, or 1 yen, each has
100 PIPs; 10 cents, 10 pence, 10 centime, or 10 yen have 1000 PIPs; 1 dollar,
1 Euro, 1 pound, 1 franc, or 100 yen have 10,000 PIPs, and so forth.
The Quarters Theory recognizes that when represented in terms of
PIPs, the distance of 10 cents, 10 pence, 10 centimes, 10 yen, and so onbetween each two Major Whole Numbers establishes well-deﬁned rangesof exactly 1000 PIPs. Each one of these 1000 PIP Ranges between two
Major Whole Numbers has 9 other whole numbers. Increments of 1 unit(1 cent, 1 penny, 1 centime, 1 yen, etc.) equal to 100 PIPs separate eachtwo whole numbers. The distance between two whole numbers deﬁnes a
smaller range of exactly 100 PIPs.

4 THE QUARTERS THEORY
FIGURE 1.1 1000 PIP Range between the Major Whole Numbers 1.3000 and
1.4000
Consider the illustration in Figure 1.1 showing the 1000 PIP Range be-
tween the Major Whole Numbers 1.3000 and 1.4000. The Major Whole Num-
ber 1.3000 represents a critical junction that marks the end of a previous
1000 PIP Range between the major Whole Numbers 1.2000 and 1.3000 and,at the same time, the beginning of the 1000 PIP Range between 1.3000 and
1.4000. The Major Whole Number 1.4000 marks the end of the 1000 PIP
Range between 1.3000 and 1.4000 and, at the same time, the beginningof another 1000 PIP Range between 1.4000 and 1.5000. Within the Major
Whole Numbers 1.3000 and 1.4000, there are 9 other whole numbers: 1.31,
1.32, 1.33, 1.34, 1.35, 1.36, 1.37, 1.38 and 1.39. The distance between eachone of the whole numbers 1.3000 and 1.3100, 1.3100 and 1.3200 ..., 1.3900
and 1.4000 marks ten smaller ranges of 100 PIPs each within the large1000 PIP Range between the Major Whole Numbers 1.3000 and 1.4000.
THE QUARTERS
Aquarter is one of four equal parts of something. It can be one-fourth of
an hour, one-fourth of a kilo or a pound, or with money, it is the U.S. or the
Canadian coin equal to one-fourth of a dollar.
The Quarters Theory focuses on the 1000 PIP Ranges between the
Major Whole Numbers in currency exchange rates and divides these rangesinto four equal parts, called Large Quarters. Each 1000 PIP Range contains

four Large Quarters and each Large Quarter has exactly 250 PIPs (1000 PIP
Range/4 =250 PIPs). The numbers that mark the beginning and the end of
each Large Quarter are given the name Large Quarter Points. The Large
Quarter Points that coincide with Major Whole Numbers are also calledMajor Large Quarter Points, because they represent critical junctions that
signal the end of a previous and, at the same time, the beginning of a new
1000 PIP Range. The exact half point of each 1000 PIP Range coincides
with a Large Quarter Point and is also called the Major Half Point of the
1000 PIP Range.
The illustration in Figure 1.2 shows the 1000 PIP Range between the
Major Whole Numbers 1.3000 and 1.4000 divided into four equal parts or
four Large Quarters of 250 PIPs. The four Large Quarters are marked bythe Large Quarter Points: 1.3000 and 1.3250, 1.3250 and 1.3500, 1.3500 and
1.3750, 1.3750 and 1.4000. Note that the Major Large Quarter Points are
also the Major Whole Numbers 1.3000 and 1.4000 that deﬁne the 1000 PIPRange. The exact half point of the 1000 PIP Range between 1.3000 and
1.4000 is the Large Quarter Point 1.3500 (LQP 1.3500), which is also the
Major Half Point of the 1000 PIP Range between 1.3000 and 1.4000.
The 100 PIP Ranges between two whole numbers in currency exchange
rates are also divided by The Quarters Theory into four equal parts calledSmall Quarters . Each 100 PIP Range contains four Small Quarters and
each Small Quarter has exactly 25 PIPs (100 PIP Range/4 =25 PIPs). The
numbers that mark the beginning and the end of each Small Quarter are

given the name Small Quarter Points . The Small Quarter Points that co-
incide with Whole Numbers are also called Major Small Quarter Points ,
because they represent critical junctions that signal the end of a previous
and, at the same time, the beginning of a new 100 PIP Range. The exactmiddle point of each 100 PIP Range coincides with a Small Quarter Point
and is also called the Half Point of the 100 PIP Range.
Figure 1.3 shows the 100 PIP Range between the Whole Numbers
1.3000 and 1.3100. The 100 PIP Range is divided into four equal parts or
four Small Quarters of 25 PIPs. The four Small Quarters are marked bythe Small Quarter Points: 1.3000 and 1.3025, 1.3025 and 1.3050, 1.3050 and
1.3075, 1.3075 and 1.3100. Note that the Major Small Quarter Points are
also the Whole Numbers 1.3000 and 1.3100 that deﬁne the 100 PIP Range.The exact middle point of the 100 PIP Range between 1.3000 and 1.3100 is
the Small Quarter Point 1.3050, which is also the Half Point of the 100 PIP
Range between 1.3000 and 1.3100.
Two of the Large Quarter Points in each 1000 PIP Range always coin-
cide with the Half Point of a 100 PIP Range. The two Large Quarter Pointsin each 1000 PIP Range that are also Half Points of a 100 PIP Range are theLarge Quarter Point positioned 250 PIPs above a Major Large Quarter Point
and the Large Quarter Point 250 PIPs below a Major Large Quarter Point.
For example, within the 1000 PIP Range between the Major Large QuarterPoints 1.3000 and 1.4000, the Large Quarter Point 1.3250, which is 250 PIPs
above the Major Large Quarter Point 1.3000, is also the Half Point of the
100 PIP Range between the whole numbers 1.3200 and 1.3300. Within the

same 1000 PIP Range, the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, which is 250 PIPs
below the Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000, is also the Half Point of the
100 PIP Range between the whole numbers 1.3700 and 1.3800.
The Large Quarters within the 1000 PIP Ranges and the Small Quarters
within the 100 PIP Ranges may be represented by different digits measur-ing the exchange rates in a variety of currency pairs, but the price ranges
remain constant. The range between two Large Quarter Points is always
exactly 250 PIPs, and the range between two Major Large Quarter Points
(Major Whole Numbers) is always exactly 1000 PIPs. The same is true forthe 100 PIP Ranges and the Small Quarters: The range between two Small
Quarter Points is always exactly 25 PIPs and the range between two Major
Small Quarter Points (Whole Numbers) is always exactly 100 PIPs, no mat-ter which currency pair and no matter what digits represent the currency
exchange rate.
For example, an exchange rate between the EUR/USD may show a
1000 PIP Range between the Major Large Quarter Points 1.3000 and 1.4000with four Large Quarters of 250 PIPs each between the Large Quarter
Points: 1.3000 and 1.3250, 1.3250 and 1.3500, 1.3500 and 1.3750, 1.3750and 1.4000. On the other hand, the USD/JPY pair may have its exchange
rate within the 1000 PIP Range between the Major Large Quarter Points
100.00 and 110.00 yen, with four Large Quarters of 250 PIPs each betweenthe Large Quarter Points 100.00 and 102.50, 102.50 and 105.00, 105.00 and
107.50, and 107.50 and 110.00. Obviously, the Major Whole Numbers and
the Large Quarter Points in the exchange rates of these two currency pairs
have different digits and numeral representation. However, whether a 1000
PIP Range is between the Major Large Quarter Points 100.00 and 110.00,or the Major Large Quarter Points 1.3000 and 1.4000, the range between
two Major Large Quarter Points (Major Whole Numbers) always remains a
range of exactly 1000 PIPs. Whether a Large Quarter is between the LargeQuarter Points 1.3500 and 1.3750, or between the Large Quarter Points
105.00 to 107.50, the range of each Large Quarter remains the same and
is always exactly a range of 250 PIPs.
The Quarters Theory offers universal, constant, and familiar price
ranges that allow quick and precise price analysis of any currency pair.The Quarters Theory provides traders with the ability to locate in a matterof seconds the exact 1000 PIP Range, the exact Large Quarter of 250 PIPs,
and, with even further precision, the exact 100 PIP Range and the exact
Small Quarter of 25 PIPs where the current exchange rate is positioned.
The following is an example of a price analysis of the exchange rates
of three currency pairs using the methodology of The Quarters Theory.Table 1.2 shows the currency pairs EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and AUD/USD atspeciﬁc price levels. The exact positioning of the exchange rate of each one

QUARTERS THEORY
The Quarters Theory is based on the premise that the daily ﬂuctuations of
currency exchange rates are not random and that currency exchange rates
ﬂuctuate in an orderly manner between the Large Quarter Points within
each 1000 PIP Range deﬁned by two Major Whole Numbers (Major LargeQuarter Points). The Quarters Theory proposes that every signiﬁcant price
move in currency exchange rates takes place from one Large Quarter Point
to another, in gradual increments of 250 PIPs, the range between two LargeQuarter Points.
The Quarters Theory challenges the notion that the ﬁnancial markets
are chaotic and that market prices are random. With its clearly deﬁned,constant price ranges of 250 PIPs and orderly price moves from one Large
Quarter Point to the next, The Quarters Theory organizes the daily ﬂuctu-
ations of currency exchange rates in a systematic arrangement. The Quar-ters Theory provides the roadmap—the 1000 PIP Ranges divided in four
equal parts or four Large Quarters of 250 PIPs each—and establishes the
route with a distinct starting point and a clear destination—every signif-icant price move begins at a Large Quarter Point and ends at a Large
Quarter Point.
The Large Quarter Points serve as constant support/resistance lev-
els, as well as familiar, invariable price targets. A bullish price breakoutabove a Large Quarter Point is expected to target the Large Quarter Point

The Foundation of The Quarters Theory 9
above, and a bearish breakout below a Large Quarter Point is likely to
challenge the Large Quarter Point below. When a targeted Large Quar-
ter Point is reached, the Large Quarter is considered to be completed. If
prices fail to complete a Large Quarter, the unsuccessful completion ofa Large Quarter usually causes a reversal that takes prices back toward
the preceding Large Quarter Point. The outcome of both events always
leads to a price move that targets a familiar level—a Large Quarter Point.
The repetitions of the series of Large Quarter completions from one Large
Quarter point to the next, or reversals back toward a preceding LargeQuarter Point as a result of unsuccessful completions, regularly manifest
themselves as recognizable price patterns in the daily ﬂuctuations of cur-
rency exchange rates.
Let us try to recognize these price patterns by following the daily ﬂuc-
tuations of the USD/JPY currency pair’s exchange rate in the months ofFebruary, March, and April 2009 (see Figure 1.4). The Quarters Theory pro-vides the roadmap, which in this real-life example is the 1000 PIP Range be-
tween the Major Whole Numbers (Major Large Quarter Points) 90.00 and
100.00 yen, divided into four Large Quarters of 250 PIPs between the LargeQuarter Points: 90.00 and 92.50, 92.50 and 95.00, 95.00 and 97.50, 97.50 and
100.00. Note that on the left-hand side of the chart, in the beginning of

10 THE QUARTERS THEORY
February 2009, the USD/JPY pair’s exchange rate produces a bullish break-
out above the Major Large Quarter Point at 90.00 yen, enters the 1000 PIP
Range between 90.00 and 100.00, and begins to work on the Large Quarter
between the Major Large Quarter Point 90.00 and the Large Quarter Point92.50. The ﬁrst attempt does not successfully complete the Large Quarter
and prices reverse back toward the preceding Major Large Quarter Point
90.00, but after ﬁnding support above the Major Large Quarter Point 90.00,
by mid-February, the USD/JPY pair manages to complete the Large Quarter
90.00 to 92.50 by reaching the Large Quarter Point 92.50.
In the following days, the pair produces a bullish breakout above the
Large Quarter Point 92.50 and begins to work on the Large Quarter above92.50, potentially targeting the Large Quarter Point 95.00, which is also theMajor Half Point of the 1000 PIP Range between 90.00 and 100.00 yen. By
the end of February, the USD/JPY pair successfully completes the Large
Quarter 92.50 to 95.00, produces a bullish breakout above the Large Quar-ter Point 95.00 and begins to work on another Large Quarter above 95.00,
potentially targeting the Large Quarter Point 97.50. The pair manages to
complete the Large Quarter 95.00 to 97.50 without any hesitation or pricepullbacks toward the preceding Large Quarter Point, and even makes an at-
tempt to work on the Large Quarter 97.50 to 100.00 by producing a bullish
breakout above the Large Quarter Point 97.50.
After several unsuccessful attempts to complete the Large Quarter
97.50 to 100.00, followed by reversals back toward the preceding LargeQuarter Point 97.50, the USD/JPY pair breaks below the Large Quarter
Point 97.50 and completes the Large Quarter 97.50 to 95.00 toward the
Major Half Point of the 1000 PIP Range between the Major Large Quar-ter Points 90.00 and 100.00. The pair then fails to produce a decisive bear-
ish breakout below the Large Quarter Point (Major Half Point) 95.00, ﬁnds
support at the Large Quarter Point 95.00, and successfully completes theLarge Quarter 95.00 to 97.50. A bullish breakout above the Large Quar-
ter Point 97.50 sees the USD/JPY pair once again working on the Large
Quarter above 97.50, potentially targeting the Major Large Quarter Point100.00. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts followed by reversals back
toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 97.50, the pair ﬁnds support at
the Large Quarter Point 97.50 and ﬁnally manages to successfully completethe Large Quarter 97.50 to 100.00 by reaching the Major Large Quarter Point
100.00 in the beginning of April 2009. In this example, the series of price
moves (Large Quarter completions and reversals back toward a precedingLarge Quarter Point as a result of unsuccessful completions) between the
Large Quarter Points within the 1000 PIP Range deﬁned by the Major Whole
Numbers (Major Large Quarter Points) 90.00 and 100.00 regularly manifestthemselves as recognizable price patterns in the daily ﬂuctuations of the
USD/JPY pair’s exchange rate.

The Foundation of The Quarters Theory 11
The Quarters Theory divides each Large Quarter of 250 PIPs into ten
equal parts or ten Small Quarters of 25 PIPs. The Quarters Theory pro-
poses that currency exchange rates ﬂuctuate in an organized manner not
only between the Large Quarter Points of each 1000 PIP range, but alsobetween the Small Quarter Points of each 100 PIP Range marked by two
Whole Numbers positioned within each Large Quarter. Currency exchange
rates ﬂuctuate in orderly series of price moves from one Small Quarter
Point to the next, measured in increments of 25 PIPs, in a systematic effort
to complete an entire Large Quarter of 250 PIPs.
Since some Small Quarter Points are also Large Quarter Points and ev-
ery signiﬁcant price move takes place from one Large Quarter Point to thenext, every sequence of Small Quarter price moves always begins from aSmall Quarter Point which coincides with a Large Quarter Point and al-
ways ends at a Small Quarter Point which is also a Large Quarter Point.
A successful completion of ten consecutive Small Quarters of 25 PIPseach would lead to the successful completion of an entire Large Quarter
of 250 PIPs, but in most instances all ten Small Quarters are not likely to
be completed at once without going through periods of price correctionsand consolidations. Because of the importance of the Whole Numbers as
critical junctions that mark the beginning and the end of each 100 PIP
Range within the Large Quarters, small price corrections and consolida-tions may be expected in the vicinity of each Whole Number, which is also
a Major Small Quarter Point, especially after a series of four Small Quar-
ter price moves completes a 100 PIP Range between two Whole Numbers/
Major Small Quarter Points. The ultimate goal of each series of Small Quar-
ter price moves is to complete an entire Large Quarter of 250 PIPs. Anyfailure to do so usually causes reversals that take prices back toward the
preceding Large Quarter Point.
The real-life example in Figure 1.5 shows the series of Small Quar-
ter price moves completing the Large Quarter from the Large QuarterPoint 1.1750 to the Large Quarter Point 1.1500 in the exchange rate of the
USD/CAD currency pair. The Large Quarter range of 250 PIPs is dividedinto ten equal parts or ten Small Quarters of 25 PIPs. The sequence of
downward Small Quarter price moves begins from the area of the Small
Quarter Point 1.1750, which coincides with the Large Quarter Point 1.1750.Note that all ten Small Quarters are not completed at once and that there
are periods of price pullbacks and consolidations, especially in the vicin-
ity of the Whole Numbers/Major Small Quarter Points 1.1700 and 1.1600,which are important junctions marking the beginning and the end of the
100 PIP Ranges between the Whole Numbers/Major Small Quarter Points
1.1700 and 1.1600. The series of downward Small Quarter price movesresumes after each pullback and consolidation, leading to the successful
completion of the Large Quarter 1.1750 to 1.1500.

12 THE QUARTERS THEORY
FIGURE 1.5 Small Quarter Price Moves Completing a Large Quarter Example
COMPLETION OF THE LARGE QUARTERS
How often have you seen the exact number of a Large Quarter Point being
registered as a high, low, open, or close price? You probably have not of-ten seen this because price volatility has the tendency to conceal the Large
Quarter Points, making them difﬁcult to recognize. Although in some casesprice moves can stop when a Large Quarter Point is reached exactly upto the PIP, in most instances, prices either surpass the exact number of a
Large Quarter Point by a few PIPs or stay a few PIPs short of reaching it.
In periods of high volume and volatility, prices may move beyond the exactnumber of a Large Quarter Point, producing an overshoot above the Large
Quarter Point, while in periods of low volatility and volume, prices may un-
dershoot a Large Quarter Point, coming a few PIPs short of the exact num-
ber of a Large Quarter Point. These overshoots and undershoots disguise
the Large Quarter Points under a veil of random numbers, creating the per-
ception of chaos and lack of purpose and organization in price ﬂuctuations.
The Quarters Theory designates the range of one Small Quarter of
25 PIPs above a Large Quarter Point as the Overshoot Area and the range
of one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs below a Large Quarter Point as the Under-
shoot Area. Any bullish price move that surpasses a Large Quarter Point
by up to 25 PIPs and stays within the range of the Overshoot Area is
considered to be a Bullish Overshoot above the Large Quarter Point. A

The Foundation of The Quarters Theory 13
bearish price move that surpasses up to 25 PIPs below a Large Quarter
Point and stays within the range of the Overshoot Area is considered a
Bearish Overshoot below the Large Quarter Point. Price moves that reach
the Undershoot Area of one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs from a Large Quarter
Point but come short of hitting the exact number of a Large Quarter Point
are considered undershoots.
Figure 1.6 is an example of an Undershoot and a Bearish Overshoot.
Note that in the beginning of the chart there is a bullish price move toward
the Large Quarter Point 1.1750. Prices enter the Undershoot Area within25 PIPs or one Small Quarter 1.1725 to 1.1750 from the Large Quarter Point
1.1750; however, they fail to reach the exact number of the Large Quarter
Point and stay a few PIPs short of it, producing an Undershoot. The Under-shoot is followed by a strong bearish move that sees prices falling toward
the Large Quarter Point 1.1500 in an attempt to complete the Large Quarter
1.1750 to 1.1500. The strong bearish price move overshoots a few PIPs be-low the Large Quarter Point 1.1500 and enters the Overshoot Area of one
Small Quarter of 25 PIPs (1.1500 to 1.1475) producing a Bearish Overshoot
below the Large Quarter Point 1.1500.
Overshoots and undershoots occur not only around the Large Quar-
ter Points but also when price moves target whole numbers or importantsupport/resistance levels in an attempt to produce breakouts. The Quar-ters Theory requires a price move larger than one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs
above (or below for bearish moves) an important price level in order to

14 THE QUARTERS THEORY
qualify a move as a decisive breakout. Price moves of 25 PIPs or less above
(or below for bearish moves) a Large Quarter Point, a Whole Number, or a
support/resistance level should be identiﬁed as overshoots. Proper recogni-
tion of overshoots is crucial when trying to spot and avoid fake breakouts,which will be discussed in the chapter on technical analysis.
By deﬁning the characteristics of overshoots and undershoots, The
Quarters Theory eliminates the noise and confusion caused by random
numbers around each Large Quarter Point. Because of the frequent devel-
opments of overshoots and undershoots, The Quarters Theory does notrequire prices to hit each Large Quarter Point exactly up to the PIP when
considering the completion of a Large Quarter. As long as there is a number
registered as a high, low, open, or close price within one Small Quarter of25 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point, The Quarters Theory would
consider a Large Quarter to be successfully completed. The same rule ap-
plies for reversals that take prices back toward a preceding Large QuarterPoint—as long as a high, low, open, or close price number is registered
within one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point,
a reversal toward a preceding Large Quarter Point is considered to becompleted.
The example in Figure 1.7 shows the EUR/USD pair’s exchange rate
moving higher in an attempt to complete the Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500.Despite the strong move, prices stay below the Large Quarter Point 1.3500

but manage to enter the Undershoot Area of the Small Quarter 1.3475 to
1.3500. As soon as a number within 25 PIPs from the Large Quarter Point
1.3500 is registered, the bullish price move from the Large Quarter Point
1.3250 to the targeted Large Quarter Point 1.3500 successfully completesthe Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500.
Any price moves that reach the Undershoot Area within 25 PIPs from
a Large Quarter Point would be close enough to produce a successful com-
pletion of a Large Quarter. However, if prices come short of a Large Quarter
Point by more than 25 PIPs, the Large Quarter will not be considered com-plete. Shortcomings larger than 25 PIPs from a Large Quarter Point should
be recognized as a warning sign of an unsuccessful completion of a Large
Quarter that may cause prices to reverse back toward the preceding LargeQuarter Point.
Consider the example in Figure 1.8, which shows the EUR/USD cur-
rency pair working on the Large Quarter above the Large Quarter Point1.3250, potentially targeting the Large Quarter Point 1.3500. Note that the
pair reaches a high in the 1.3450 region that is below the Large Quarter
Point 1.3500 and outside of the Undershoot Area of the Small Quarter1.3475 to 1.3500. The failure of the EUR/USD pair’s exchange rate to reach a
number within 25 PIPs from the Large Quarter Point 1.3500 leads to the un-
successful completion of the Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500, which causesprices to reverse back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 1.3250.

16 THE QUARTERS THEORY
1000 PIP RANGE TRANSITIONS
The 1000 PIP Ranges are the ranges between two Major Whole Numbers.
The Major Large Quarter Points that represent the Major Whole Num-
bers mark the beginning and the end of each 1000 PIP Range. Currencyexchange rates ﬂuctuate between the Large Quarter Points within the
1000 PIP Ranges. Although exchange rates can remain within the same
1000 PIP Range for long periods of time, they do not stay indeﬁnitely con-
ﬁned within the same 1000 PIP Range and may sooner or later leave the
current and transition into brand-new 1000 PIP Ranges.
The new 1000 PIP Range Transitions usually occur as a result of major
shifts in underlying fundamentals for currencies. Existing trends can eitheraccelerate or reverse when the market realizes that the current 1000 PIPRange of a currency pair’s exchange rate no longer sufﬁciently reﬂects the
fundamental backdrop for the currencies in the pair. The signiﬁcant price
moves that occur as a result of rapid “pricing in” of market-moving funda-mental developments can push currency exchange rates outside of a cur-
rent and into a new 1000 PIP Range. The Quarters Theory recognizes such
market moves as attempts to transition the currency exchange rates intonew 1000 PIP Ranges.
The chart in Exhibit 1.9 shows an example of a 1000 PIP Range Tran-
sition. Note that the exchange rate of the EUR/USD pair ﬂuctuates within

the 1000 PIP Range between the Major Whole Numbers 1.2000 and 1.3000.
On March 17, 2009, the EUR/USD pair breaks above the Major Whole Num-
ber and Major Large Quarter Point at 1.3000 and transitions into the new
1000 PIP Range between the Major Whole Numbers and the Major LargeQuarter Points 1.3000 and 1.4000.
Multiple 1000 PIP Range Transitions are possible in times when strong
trends accelerate. The chart in Figure 1.10 shows the GBP/USD pair in a
strong downtrend, rapidly moving lower. In a period of just a couple of
months, October and November 2008, the pair produces multiple success-ful 1000 PIP Range transitions: falling below the Major Whole Number and
the Major Large Quarter Point at 1.8000 into a new 1000 PIP Range be-
tween 1.8000 and 1.7000, later dropping below the Major Large QuarterPoint 1.7000 into a new 1000 PIP Range between 1.7000 and 1.6000, and
then falling below the Major Large Quarter Point 1.6000 into a new 1000
PIP Range between 1.6000 and 1.5000.
New 1000 PIP Range Transitions begin as an attempt to challenge and
break above or below a Major Whole Number and a Major Large QuarterPoint. Breakouts may not be as decisive and may fail on the ﬁrst attempt.If a currency pair simply overshoots above or below a Major Large Quar-
ter Point by an insigniﬁcant amount of PIPs (usually 25 PIPs or less), The

18 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Quarters Theory would recognize such small overshoots as a warning sign
of an unsuccessful breakout. Unsuccessful breakouts above or below Ma-
jor Large Quarter Points could cause unsuccessful transitions into the new
1000 PIP Ranges and as a result, exchange rates may remain within theircurrent 1000 PIP Range. Moreover, unsuccessful breakouts and unsuccess-
ful 1000 PIP Range Transitions may often lead to complete reversals of pre-
viously established trends that have failed to produce a successful 1000 PIP
Range Transition.
The chart in Figure 1.11 shows an example of an unsuccessful 1000 PIP
Range Transition. Note that the USD/CAD is in an uptrend, making an at-tempt to break above the Major Large Quarter Point 1.3000 and transition
from the current 1000 PIP Range between 1.2000 and 1.3000 into a new1000 PIP Range above 1.3000. The pair overshoots the Major Large Quar-
ter Point 1.3000 by an insigniﬁcant amount of PIPs and fails to produce a
decisive breakout. The failed breakout above 1.3000 leads to an unsuccess-ful transition into the new 1000 PIP Range above 1.3000 and the USD/CAD
pair’s exchange rate remains within the current 1000 PIP Range. Please
note that the unsuccessful 1000 PIP Range Transition above 1.3000 causesexhaustion of the bullish trend and leads to a complete reversal of the pre-
viously established uptrend.
Every attempt for a breakout above or below a Major Large Quarter
Point coincides with an attempt from a currency pair to begin to work on

the ﬁrst Large Quarter of 250 PIPs of a new 1000 PIP Range. A decisive
breakout could produce a decisive entrance into a Large Quarter, but if the
ﬁrst Large Quarter of a new 1000 PIP Range is not successfully completed,
exhaustion may occur, leading to a reversal back toward the Major LargeQuarter Point and into the preceding 1000 PIP Range.
Consider the example in Figure 1.12 showing the USD/JPY in a strong
uptrend. The pair makes an attempt to break above the Major Large Quar-
ter Point at 100.00 and to transition from the current 1000 PIP Range
between 90.00 and 100.00 into a new 1000 PIP Range above 100.00. TheUSD/JPY produces a successful breakout above the Major Large Quarter
Point at 100.00 and makes a decisive entrance into the ﬁrst Large Quarter
of the new 1000 PIP Range—the Large Quarter 100.00 to 102.50. However,the pair fails to complete the ﬁrst Large Quarter 100.00 to 102.50 of the
new 1000 PIP Range, leading to an exhaustion of the bullish trend and a
reversal back toward the preceding Major Large Quarter Point 100.00. Theunsuccessful completion of the ﬁrst Large Quarter of the new 1000 PIP
Range also sees the USD/JPY exchange rate falling back into the previous
1000 PIP Range below the Major Large Quarter Point 100.00.
Only a completion of the ﬁrst Large Quarter of a new 1000 PIP Range
can serve as an indication of a successful 1000 PIP Range Transition. Asusual, a successful completion of a Large Quarter would require prices to

reach a number at least within one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs from the Large
Quarter Point being targeted.
The chart in Figure 1.13 shows an example of a successful 1000 PIP
Range Transition as a result of a completion of the ﬁrst Large Quarter ofa new 1000 PIP Range. Please note that the EUR/USD pair is in a strong
uptrend, making an attempt to break above the Major Large Quarter Point
1.3000 and transition from its current 1000 PIP Range between 1.2000 and
1.3000 into a new 1000 PIP Range above 1.3000. At the same time, the pair
also makes an attempt to work on the ﬁrst Large Quarter of 250 PIPs ofthe new 1000 PIP Range—the Large Quarter from the Major Large Quarter
Point 1.3000 to the Large Quarter Point at 1.3250. The EUR/USD pair pro-
duces a decisive breakout above the Major Large Quarter Point 1.3000 andmanages to complete the Large Quarter 1.3000 to 1.3250. The completion
of the ﬁrst Large Quarter 1.3000 to 1.3250 conﬁrms the successful transi-
tion into the new 1000 PIP Range between the Major Large Quarter Points1.3000 and 1.4000.
Successful 1000 PIP Range Transitions are a sign of strength and an
indication of a potential continuation of an existing trend, especially if theexchange rate remains within the new 1000 PIP range and does not fall
back into its preceding 1000 PIP Range by breaking above or below the

Major Large Quarter Point. A successful, decisive transition into a new 1000
PIP Range could accelerate the trend and may often lead to further price
moves beyond the ﬁrst Large Quarter and into the second Large Quarter
of 250 PIPs of a new 1000 PIP range. Such moves into the second LargeQuarter of a new 1000 PIP Range are an indication that the existing trend
is strong and that prices may continue to advance toward the exact half
point of the new 1000 PIP Range—the Major Half Point.
The chart in Figure 1.14 shows an example of a successful 1000
PIP Range Transition that accelerates the existing trend, pushing pricestoward the Major Half Point of the new 1000 PIP Range and leading to a
successful completion of the second Large Quarter of the new 1000 PIP
Range. Note that the EUR/USD pair is in an uptrend, moving above theMajor Large Quarter Point 1.3000 and making an attempt to transition its
exchange rate from the 1000 PIP Range between 1.2000 and 1.3000 into
a new 1000 PIP Range above 1.3000. The pair completes the ﬁrst LargeQuarter 1.3000 to 1.3250 of the new 1000 PIP Range and conﬁrms that the
exchange rate has transitioned successfully into the new 1000 PIP Range.
The successful 1000 PIP Range Transition accelerates the existing trend(note how the momentum spikes up above the Major Large Quarter Point
1.3000 on the chart) and pushes prices further toward the Major Half Point

1.3500 of the new 1000 PIP Range between 1.3000 and 1.4000, leading to a
successful completion of the second Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500 of the
new 1000 PIP Range.
A completion of the second Large Quarter of a new 1000 PIP Range
serves as a conﬁrmation that the exchange rate of a currency pair hasmade a decisive transition into the new 1000 PIP Range. Successful 1000
PIP Range Transitions conﬁrmed by the fact that the Major Half Point of
a 1000 PIP Range has been reached are also an indication of potential fur-
ther advances into the 1000 PIP Range beyond the Major Half Point in aneffort for currency exchange rates to complete the entire 1000 PIP Range.
Although moves toward the Major Half Point of each 1000 PIP Range are
an indication of a strong trend, in most instances all four Large Quartersof an entire 1000 PIP Range would most likely not be completed without
any major price corrections and pullbacks that could take prices back to-
ward the preceding Major Large Quarter Point. If prices during such cor-rections stay above (or below) the Major Large Quarter Point and do not
move back into the previous 1000 PIP Range, further advances within the
new 1000 PIP Range can be expected as an attempt to complete the entire1000 PIP Range.
Consider the example shown in Figure 1.15 where on the left-hand side
of the chart the USD/JPY exchange rate makes a decisive transition into the

new 1000 PIP Range between 100.00 and 90.00 yen by completing the ﬁrst
Large Quarter 100.00 to 97.50 and the second Large Quarter 97.50 to the Ma-
jor Half Point 95.00. The pair even reaches as far as the Large Quarter Point
92.50 and completes three out of four Large Quarters of the new 1000 PIPRange—the Large Quarters 100.00 to 97.50, 97.50 to 95.00, and 95.00 to
92.50. After the large move, the pair goes through a signiﬁcant price cor-
rection that takes prices back toward the preceding Major Large Quarter
Point 100.00. Despite the pullback, the USD/JPY exchange rate stays below
the Major Large Quarter Point 100.00 and does not move into the previous1000 PIP Range above 100.00, indicating that the exchange rate will remain
within the new 1000 PIP Range. The pair then advances further into the
1000 PIP Range below 100.00, this time managing to complete all four LargeQuarters (100.00 to 97.50, 97.50 to 95.00, 95.00 to 92.50, and 92.50 to 90.00)
and successfully completing the entire 1000 PIP Range from 100.00 to 90.00.
The Quarters Theory recognizes the 1000 PIP Range Transitions as im-
portant events that indicate major shifts in currency exchange rates. Theseevents are not chaotic; the 1000 PIP Range Transitions develop through
orderly moves from one Large Quarter Point to the next within constant,predictable ranges of 250 and 1000 PIPs. Although a 1000 PIP Range may
be new to a currency pair’s exchange rate, the number of PIPs in the range
is not foreign; it is always exactly 1000 PIPs, and each 1000 PIP Rangealways has the familiar four Large Quarters of exactly 250 PIPs each. Suc-
cessful 1000 PIP Range Transitions do not occur randomly, without a pur-
pose. They represent necessary adjustments in exchange rates made by the
market in order to reﬂect more accurately any considerable changes in the
underlying fundamentals of a currency pair.
LARGE QUARTER TRANSITIONS
The ﬂuctuations of currency exchange rates do not stop after completinga Large Quarter; they continue into perpetuity. As prices ﬂuctuate from
one Large Quarter Point to the next, multiple Large Quarters may be com-
pleted as long as currency exchange rates regularly transition from oneLarge Quarter to another Large Quarter. The Large Quarter Transition is
the process of transfer in prices from the 250 PIP Range of one Large Quar-
ter into a new 250 PIP Range of another Large Quarter.
The chart in Figure 1.16 shows the EUR/USD currency pair’s exchange
rate producing multiple Large Quarter Transitions, followed by success-ful completions of ﬁve consecutive Large Quarters. As the EUR/USD pairmoves higher, prices transition into the Large Quarter 1.3000 to 1.3250
and complete it successfully. After completing the Large Quarter 1.3000
to 1.3250, the pair continues its upward move, the EUR/USD exchange

rate transitions into the new 250 PIP Range of the Large Quarter 1.3250 to
1.3500, and, despite the temporary ﬂattening and hesitation, prices move
higher, completing the Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500. The remarkable se-
quence of Large Quarter Transitions and Large Quarter completions con-tinues, further resulting in the successful completion of ﬁve consecutive
Large Quarters—1.3000 to 1.3250, 1.3250 to 1.3500, 1.3500 to 1.3750, 1.3750
to 1.4000, and 1.4000 to 1.4250—in a period of only ﬁve trading sessions.
The outcome of a Large Quarter Transition is vital to the completion
of each Large Quarter. Unless there were a successful Large Quarter Tran-sition, there would not even be an attempt to complete a new Large Quar-ter. So what constitutes successful Large Quarter Transitions, and how can
traders distinguish them from the unsuccessful ones?
As prices surpass a Large Quarter Point, the ﬁrst area that they enter
is the Overshoot Area 25 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point. Byreaching a number within the Overshoot Area, prices have already entered
the new Large Quarter; but if prices remain within the Overshoot Area ofone Small Quarter of 25 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point and
never continue further into the range of a new Large Quarter, The Quarters
Theory will recognize such development as an Overshoot. Overshoots areprice inertia left over from the signiﬁcant price move that has targeted a
Large Quarter Point. They are not indicative of a decisive entrance of pricesinto the new Large Quarter. This is why overshoots of up to 25 PIPs above

The Foundation of The Quarters Theory 25
or below a Large Quarter Point are not considered to be successful Large
Quarter Transitions. Overshoots should be recognized as warning signs of
unsuccessful Large Quarter Transitions, which usually cause prices to re-
main within a previous Large Quarter.
The example in Figure 1.17 shows the GBP/USD currency pair’s ex-
change rate completing the Large Quarter 1.5250 to 1.5500 and surpassingthe Large Quarter Point 1.5500 in an attempt for a Large Quarter Transition
into the new Large Quarter 1.5500 to 1.5750. However, prices only produce
an Overshoot of 25 PIPs or less above the Large Quarter Point 1.5500 andnever exit the Overshoot Area of the Small Quarter 1.5500 to 1.5525. The
Overshoot signals unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition followed by a re-
versal as prices fall below the Large Quarter Point 1.5500 and remain withinthe range of the previous Large Quarter.
Unsuccessful Large Quarter Transitions are easier to recognize in
cases when prices do not overshoot a Large Quarter Point and stay withinthe Undershoot Area of a Large Quarter Point. The Quarters Theory
considers undershoots as an indication of shortcomings of price moves
targeting Large Quarter Points that may serve as warning signs of unsuc-cessful Large Quarter Transitions. Unsuccessful Large Quarter Transitions
as a result of undershoots usually cause prices to remain within the current
Large Quarter.

FIGURE 1.18 Undershoot Signaling Unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition
The example in Figure 1.18 shows the EUR/USD currency pair’s ex-
change rate completing the Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500. Prices reach
the Undershoot Area of the Small Quarter 1.3475 to 1.3500 but do not sur-
pass the Large Quarter Point 1.3500. The Undershoot of 25 PIPs or lessbelow the Large Quarter Point 1.3500 signals unsuccessful Large Quarter
Transition, which causes prices to remain within the range of the current
Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500.
Price moves that attempt a Large Quarter Transition above or below a
Large Quarter Point see currency exchange rates enter an important areacalled the Hesitation Zone . The Hesitation Zone is the range of 75 PIPs
above or below a Large Quarter Point. The Hesitation Zone is formed by the
ﬁrst three Small Quarters of 25 PIPs of each Large Quarter. The positioning
of the Hesitation Zone depends on the direction of the price move: If pricesmove above a Large Quarter Point, the Hesitation Zone will be 75 PIPs or
three Small Quarters above a Large Quarter Point; if prices move below
a Large Quarter Point, the Hesitation Zone will be 75 PIPs or three SmallQuarters below a Large Quarter Point.
The end of each Hesitation Zone always falls 25 PIPs or one Small
Quarter above or below the closest Whole Number to a Large QuarterPoint. The end of the Hesitation Zone never coincides with an actual Whole
Number, but rather indicates either shortcomings or overshoots of the
price moves that target the Whole Number closest to a Large Quarter Point.

The Foundation of The Quarters Theory 27
The Quarters Theory uses the Hesitation Zone to identify successful or
failed Large Quarter Transitions by distinguishing between decisive and in-
decisive entrance of prices into a new Large Quarter. The Overshoot Area
above or below a Large Quarter Point is part of the Hesitation Zone butmoves of 25 PIPs or less above or below a Large Quarter Point that re-
main within the Overshoot Area are considered simple overshoots and do
not constitute a successful Large Quarter Transition. Only decisive price
moves that target the end of the Hesitation Zone and do not break above
(or below) the preceding Large Quarter Point on pullbacks are consideredto be an indication of a successful Large Quarter Transition. Prices are
likely to remain within a new Large Quarter as a result of a successful
Large Quarter Transition, increasing the probability for further advancesinto the range of the new Large Quarter in an attempt to complete it.
The example in Figure 1.19 shows the anatomy of the GBP/USD cur-
rency pair exchange rate’s Large Quarter Transition into a new Large Quar-ter 1.5250 to 1.5500. Note that as prices move above the Large Quarters
Point 1.5250, they make a decisive entrance into the new Large Quarter by
targeting the Whole Number 1.5300, which is the closest Whole Number50 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 1.5250. As prices reach the Whole
Number 1.5300, they pull back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point
1.5250 but remain above it. After the pullback, prices make another de-cisive move toward the end of the Hesitation Zone 1.5325—three Small

Quarters of 25 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point. The GBP/USD pair’s
exchange rate overshoots above the end of the Hesitation Zone and pulls
back but, once again, it remains above the preceding Large Quarter Point
1.5250. The decisive price move toward the end of the Hesitation Zoneand the fact that the exchange rate remains above the Large Quarter Point
1.5250 on pullbacks indicates that the Large Quarter Transition into the
Large Quarter 1.5250 to 1.5500 is successful. The successful Large Quar-
ter Transition leads to price moves advancing further into the range of the
new Large Quarter, targeting the Large Quarter Point 1.5500 and ultimatelycompleting the Large Quarter 1.5250 to 1.5500.
The Quarters Theory considers decisive price moves that stretch out-
side of the Hesitation Zone and reach the Half Point of a Large Quarter as aconﬁrmation of a successful Large Quarter Transition. The Half Point is the
exact middle price point of a Large Quarter. The Half Point is positioned
125 PIPs from each one of the Large Quarter Points that deﬁne a LargeQuarter. Price moves that reach the Half Point of a Large Quarter and do
not break above (or below) the preceding Large Quarter Point on pullbacks
provide conﬁrmation that a Large Quarter Transition is successful.
The example in Figure 1.20 shows the Large Quarter Transition of
the USD/CAD currency pair’s exchange rate into a new Large Quarter

1.2000 to 1.1750. As prices attempt to transition below the Major Large
Quarter Point 1.2000, they make a decisive bearish move, stretching be-
yond the end of the Hesitation Zone 1.1925 and reaching the Half Point
1.1875 of the Large Quarter 1.2000 to 1.1750. Prices touch the Half Point1.1875 three consecutive times and pull back toward the preceding Large
Quarter Point 1.2000, but remain above it on all three of the pullbacks. The
decisive price move toward the Half Point 1.1875 and the fact that the ex-
change rate remains below the Large Quarter Point 1.2000 on the pullbacks
conﬁrms that the Large Quarter Transition into the Large Quarter 1.2000 to1.1750 is successful. The successful Large Quarter Transition ultimately
leads to the completion of the Large Quarter 1.2000 to 1.1750.
LARGE QUARTER CORRECTIONS
Although possible in some cases, in most instances multiple consecutive
Large Quarter Transitions and Large Quarter completions may not be likely
to occur at once without any price consolidations and pullbacks. Success-
ful completions of two or more consecutive Large Quarters equal moves of
500+ PIPs, and such signiﬁcant price moves are susceptible to Large Quar-
ter Price Corrections. In periods of Large Quarter Corrections, prices re-
main within the current Large Quarter, pull back toward a preceding Large
Quarter Point, or may even transition into a previous Large Quarter.
Consider the example in Figure 1.21 showing the GBP/USD currency
pair’s exchange rate moving higher, completing three consecutive LargeQuarters: 1.3750 to 1.4000, 1.4000 to 1.4250, and 1.4250 to 1.4500, transi-
tioning into a fourth Large Quarter 1.4500 to 1.4750, and producing a largeprice move of almost 1000 PIPs. The inability to complete the Large Quar-
ter 1.4500 to 1.4750 signals exhaustion and triggers a price correction. Dur-
ing the correction, the GBP/USD pair’s exchange rate remains within thesame Large Quarter 1.4500 to 1.4750 and pulls back toward the preced-
ing Large Quarter Point 1.4500. The price correction becomes even more
signiﬁcant, producing a Large Quarter Transition below the Large QuarterPoint 1.4500 into the previous Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4500, and leading
to the successful completion of the Large Quarter 1.4500 to 1.4250.
The price correction described in Figure 1.21 is triggered by the
unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter 1.4500 to 1.4750. Note in the
illustration shown in Figure 1.22, that the correction sees the GBP/USD paircompleting the Large Quarter 1.4500 to 1.4250, but prices remain above the
Large Quarter Point 1.4250 and do not transition into another Large Quar-
ter. The unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition into the new Large Quarter1.4250 to 1.4000 signals the end of the correction and the bullish Large

Quarter sequence resumes, leading to the successful completion of two
Large Quarters: 1.4250 to 1.4500 and 1.4500 to 1.4750. As prices continue
to move higher, there is also a Large Quarter Transition into a third Large
Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000; however, that Large Quarter is not completed.The unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000 signals
exhaustion and once again triggers a price correction. During the correc-
tion, the GBP/USD pair’s exchange rate remains within the same Large
Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000, pulls back toward the preceding Large Quarter
Point 1.4750, and even transitions into the previous Large Quarter 1.4500to 1.4750. However, the Large Quarter 1.4750 to 1.4500 is not completed
and the correction ends as a result of the unsuccessful completion of the
Large Quarter 1.4750 to 1.4500. The end of the correction is then followedby a Large Quarter Transition into the Large Quarter 1.4750 and 1.5000. The
Large Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000 is completed, but prices remain below the
Major Large Quarter Point 1.5000 and do not transition into the new LargeQuarter 1.5000 to 1.5250. The unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition trig-
gers a price correction, during which prices remain within the same Large
Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000 and pull back toward the preceding Large QuarterPoint 1.4750.
The examples above demonstrate the two causes that trigger the be-
ginning and the end of each Large Quarter Price Correction: unsuccessfulcompletion of a Large Quarter or unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition.
Either one of these two factors can end a sequence of signiﬁcant Large
Quarter price moves and result in a price correction, or can cause a Large
Quarter Correction to come to an end.

CHAPTER 2
Forecasting the
Large Quarter
Price Moves
ANALYZING PRICE BEHAVIOR
AT THE LARGE QUARTER POINTS
The Quarters Theory recognizes that the direction of each Large Quarter
price move from one Large Quarter Point to another and the completion of
a Large Quarter are dependent on the success or the failure of the Large
Quarter Transitions. Every transition into a new Large Quarter always be-gins at a Large Quarter Point that serves as a critical junction, marking the
end of a current and at the same time the beginning of a new Large Quar-
ter of 250 PIPs. Each signiﬁcant price move starts at a Large Quarter Point
and always ends at a Large Quarter Point; therefore, when these important
price levels are reached, The Quarters Theory requires close examinationof the price behavior of currency exchange rates for signs of strength or
weakness that can be useful when attempting to forecast the outcome of
each attempt for a Large Quarter Transition and the direction of the nextLarge Quarter price move.
The Large Quarter Points serve as constant and reliable support and
resistance levels. A Large Quarter Transition cannot occur unless the sup-port or the resistance of a Large Quarter Point is broken. The failure of an
attempt for a breakout above or below a Large Quarter Point is usually the
ﬁrst sign of an unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition. Unsuccessful LargeQuarter Transitions are an indication that the currency exchange rate is
likely to remain in its current Large Quarter. When prices move higher and
manage to complete a Large Quarter but encounter resistance at the Large

34 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Quarter Point targeted, there would be a greater probability that the next
Large Quarter move may be more likely to target the Large Quarter Point
below the Large Quarter Point that has served as resistance. The same is
valid for bearish price moves when currency exchange rates move lowerand produce a successful completion of a Large Quarter but encounter sup-
port at the Large Quarter Point targeted. In such instances, there would
be a greater probability that the next Large Quarter price move may be
more likely to target the Large Quarter Point above the Large Quarter
Point that has served as support. Based on this premise, The Quarters The-ory establishes a set of two simple rules to identify signs of strength or
weakness in the price behavior of currency exchange rates in the vicinity
of each Large Quarter Point that may signal unsuccessful Large QuarterTransitions:
Rule #1—Sign of Strength: Prices Sustaining
at or above a Large Quarter Point
This is the type of price behavior indicative of the unwillingness of the
market to see prices continuing to decline, diminishing the likelihood of a
breakout below the support of the targeted Large Quarter Point. Withouta breakout below a Large Quarter Point, there will be no Large Quarter
Transition of the currency exchange rate into a new 250 PIPs Range of
another Large Quarter below the current Large Quarter. A failed breakout
below a Large Quarter Point and a failed Large Quarter Transition cause
the exchange rate to remain within the current Large Quarter, normallyleading to a bullish price move in an attempt to complete the current Large
Quarter from the bottom up by targeting the Large Quarter Point above the
Large Quarter Point that has served as support.
Figure 2.1 shows a bearish price move in the GBP/USD pair’s exchange
rate, completing the Large Quarter 1.4500 to 1.4250 by reaching the Under-shoot Area/Small Quarter 1.4275 to 1.4250. Note that prices come shortof and never touch the exact number of the Large Quarter Point 1.4250,
diminishing the probability for a breakout below the Large Quarter Point
1.4250. Prices sustain above the Large Quarter Point—a sign of strengththat causes the exchange rate to remain within the current Large Quar-
ter. The lack of a breakout leads to an unsuccessful Large Quarter Transi-
tion into another Large Quarter below the current Large Quarter 1.4500 to1.4250. The unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition below the Large Quarter
Point 1.4250 is followed by a bullish price move in an attempt to complete
the Large Quarter from the Large Quarter Point 1.4250 that has served assupport, targeting the Large Quarter Point 1.4500.

Forecasting the Large Quarter Price Moves 35
FIGURE 2.1 Sign of Strength: Prices Sustain above a Large Quarter Point
Rule #2—Sign of Weakness: Prices Remaining
below a Large Quarter Point
This is price behavior that signals exhaustion and lack of strength in a
price move, reducing the likelihood of a breakout above the resistance of
the targeted Large Quarter Point. An unsuccessful breakout above a LargeQuarter Point would indicate an unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition
into a new 250 PIPs Range of another Large Quarter above the current
Large Quarter. As a result, prices would be likely to remain within thecurrent Large Quarter, normally leading to a bearish price move in an
attempt to complete the current Large Quarter from the top down by
targeting the Large Quarter Point below the Large Quarter Point that hasserved as resistance.
Consider the example in Figure 2.2, which shows the GBP/USD pair’s
exchange rate moving higher, completing the Large Quarter 1.4750 to1.5000. Note that although the Large Quarter is completed successfully,
prices remain below the Large Quarter Point 1.5000, a sign of weakness sig-
naling exhaustion and reducing the likelihood for a bullish breakout abovethe Large Quarter Point 1.5000. As prices stay below the Large Quarter

36 THE QUARTERS THEORY
FIGURE 2.2 Sign of Weakness: Prices Remain below a Large Quarter Point
Point 1.5000, the exchange rate remains within the current Large Quar-
ter 1.4750 to 1.5000. The lack of a bullish breakout above the Large Quarter
Point 1.5000 leads to an unsuccessful Large Quarter Transition into anotherLarge Quarter above the current Large Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000. The un-
successful Large Quarter Transition above the Large Quarter Point 1.5000
leads to a bearish price move in an attempt to complete the Large Quarterfrom the Large Quarter Point 1.5000 that has served as resistance, targeting
the Large Quarter Point 1.4750.
Analyzing Price Behavior at the Important Price
Points within the Large Quarters
The most important price levels for each Large Quarter are the two Large
Quarter Points that deﬁne it. Every signiﬁcant price move begins from a
Large Quarter Point and also ends at a Large Quarter Point. The main ques-
tion when forecasting the Large Quarter price moves is whether priceswill reach the targeted Large Quarter Point and successfully complete a
Large Quarter, or whether due to unsuccessful completion of a Large Quar-
ter, prices will reverse and target the preceding Large Quarter Point. Thenext Large Quarter price move is much easier to forecast in the previously
described instances when prices remain above or below a Large Quarter

Point and, due to unsuccessful Large Quarter Transitions, remain within
the same Large Quarter. But what if prices actually break above or below a
Large Quarter Point and transition into a new Large Quarter? Does a Large
Quarter Transition mean that the new Large Quarter will be successfullycompleted?
The Quarters Theory recognizes that Large Quarter Transitions do not
guarantee the successful completion of a Large Quarter and that price be-
havior of currency exchange rates within the actual Large Quarters should
be closely analyzed for signs of strength that could lead to the success-ful completion of a Large Quarter, or signs of weakness and exhaustion
that may cause unsuccessful Large Quarter completion and reversals back
toward the preceding Large Quarter Point. In order to monitor the price be-havior of currency exchange rates within the range of each Large Quarter,
The Quarters Theory establishes three important price levels within each
Large Quarter: (1) the End of the Hesitation Zone, (2) the Half Point, and(3) the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point. These three im-
portant price points within each Large Quarter serve as major support and
resistance levels that may prevent further price progression and may causeunsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter.
The End of the Hesitation Zone The ﬁrst important price level
within each Large Quarter is the End of the Hesitation Zone. As described
in previous chapters, the Hesitation Zone plays a key role when determin-
ing Large Quarter Transitions. Decisive price moves that target the End of
the Hesitation Zone and do not break above (or below) the preceding Large
Quarter Point on pullbacks are considered to be an indication of a success-ful Large Quarter Transition. On the other hand, prices may also hesitate
to continue further into a new Large Quarter within the area of 75 PIPs or
the ﬁrst three Small Quarters of 25 PIPs above or below a Large QuarterPoint, hence the name Hesitation Zone . If prices stay conﬁned within the
Hesitation Zone, the End of the Hesitation Zone can prove to be a difﬁcultsupport or resistance level to overcome and may prevent further progres-sion of prices beyond the range of the Hesitation Zone, leading to price
exhaustion and unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter. Strong sup-
port or resistance met at the End of the Hesitation Zone usually leads to areversal that takes prices back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point.
If currency exchange rates have difﬁculty breaking outside of the Hesita-
tion Zone and remain within it for extended time periods, prices may notonly reverse back to the preceding Large Quarter Point but may also pull
back into the range of a previous Large Quarter.
Figure 2.3 shows the GBP/USD currency pair’s exchange rate complet-
ing the Large Quarter 1.5500 to 1.5750. The pair then makes an attempt fora Large Quarter Transition into a new Large Quarter 1.5750 to 1.6000 by

entering the Hesitation Zone 75 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 1.5750.
Three attempts for a breakout above the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.5825meet resistance and after each unsuccessful breakout attempt, prices re-
verse back to the preceding Large Quarter Point 1.5750. Prices have ob-
vious difﬁculties breaking outside of the Hesitation Zone. The GBP/USDpair’s currency exchange rate remains within the Hesitation Zone for an
extended period of time and prices not only reverse back to the preceding
Large Quarter Point 1.5750 but also pull back into the range of the previousLarge Quarter 1.5500 to 1.5750.
The Half Point The Half Point is the second important price level
within each Large Quarter. The Half Point is the exact middle price point
of a Large Quarter. Price moves that stretch outside of the Hesitation Zone
and reach the Half Point of a Large Quarter provide conﬁrmation of a suc-
cessful Large Quarter Transition. The Half Point, however, can also be-come a difﬁcult support or resistance level to overcome and may prevent
further progression of prices beyond the Half Point, leading to price ex-
haustion and unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter. Strong supportor resistance met at the Half Point of a Large Quarter usually causes rever-
sals that take prices back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point.

FIGURE 2.4 Price Behavior at the Half Point of a Large Quarter
Figure 2.4 shows the USD/JPY currency pair’s exchange rate falling
below the Large Quarter Point 95.00 in an attempt to complete the Large
Quarter 95.00 to 92.50. Prices make a decisive move into the Large Quarter
but encounter strong support at the Half Point 93.75. Two unsuccessful at-tempts to break below the Half Point 93.75 prevent prices from continuing
further into the Large Quarter and lead to exhaustion and a reversal back
toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 95.00.
Whole Number Preceding a Large Quarter Point The third impor-
tant price level within each Large Quarter is the Whole Number preceding
a Large Quarter Point. The Whole Numbers deﬁne the 100 PIP Ranges and
coincide with the Major Small Quarter Points. As prices ﬂuctuate betweenthe Whole Numbers/Major Small Quarter Points and complete the 100 PIP
Ranges from one Whole Number/Major Small Quarter Point to the next, a
targeted Whole Number that marks the beginning and the end of a 100 PIPRange could become a support or resistance level that may be difﬁcult to
break. When strong support or resistance is met at a Whole Number pre-
ceding a Large Quarter Point, such a Whole Number can play a key role asthe last problematic price point that may prevent the successful comple-
tion of a Large Quarter. Failure of prices to break the support or resistance

40 THE QUARTERS THEORY
FIGURE 2.5 Price Behavior at the Whole Number Preceding a Large Quarter Point
of a Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point usually causes ex-
haustion and unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter, leading to areversal back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point.
Consider the example in Figure 2.5, which shows the AUD/USD cur-
rency pair’s exchange rate moving above the Large Quarter Point 0.7500in an attempt to complete the Large Quarter 0.7500 to 0.7750. Prices make
a decisive move into the Large Quarter but encounter strong resistance at
the Whole Number 0.7700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 0.7750. Thetwo unsuccessful attempts to break above the Whole Number 0.7700 pre-
vent prices from advancing further, causing unsuccessful completion of
the Large Quarter 0.7500 to 0.7750, and leading to exhaustion and a rever-sal back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 0.7500.
Major Short-, Mid-, or Long-Term Support/Resistance Levels
The Quarters Theory requires careful examination of each Large Quar-
ter for certain major Short-, Mid-, and Long-Term support and resistance
levels that may be positioned within the range of a Large Quarter. In in-stances when a Large Quarter contains a major Short-, Mid-, or Long-
Term support or resistance level, there may be four (or more) important

--- PAGE 59 ---

P1: SBT
c02 JWBT192-Yotov October 8, 2009 21:30 Printer: Yet to come
Forecasting the Large Quarter Price Moves 41
price levels that can be used to analyze the price behavior of currency ex-
change rates within the Large Quarters: the End of the Hesitation Zone,
the Half Point, the Whole Number preceding the Large Quarter Point, and
any Major Short-, Mid-, or Long-Term support/resistance levels. These well-established Short-, Mid-, and Long-Term support and resistance levels are
respected by the market and may prove difﬁcult to overcome. Failure to
break the support or resistance of a Major Short-, Mid-, or Long-Term sup-
port/resistance price level positioned within a Large Quarter usually causes
exhaustion and unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter, leading to areversal back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point.
Figure 2.6 shows the USD/JPY currency pair’s exchange rate ﬁnding
support below the whole number 94.00 in March 2009. Prices bounce offsupport and the USD/JPY currency pair moves higher, but prices fall a
couple of months later in May 2009 and the pair moves below the Large
Quarter Point 95.00 in an attempt to complete the Large Quarter 95.00 to92.50. As prices transition into the quarter, they approach the major multi-
month Mid-Term Support Level below 94.00 positioned within the Large
Quarter 95.00 to 92.50. The unsuccessful attempt to break below the Mid-Term Support Level below 94.00 prevents prices from advancing further,

causing unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter 95.00 to 92.50 and
leading to exhaustion and a reversal back toward the preceding Large
Quarter Point 95.00.
Major Short-, Mid-, or Long-Term support/resistance levels often coin-
cide with The Quarters Theory’s three important price points within theLarge Quarters: the End of the Hesitation Zone, the Half Point of a Large
Quarter, and the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point, or with
the actual Large Quarter Points. In such instances, these levels become
price points of double signiﬁcance that may be even tougher to break.
The main consequence of a failure to break the support or resistance of
a double-signiﬁcance price level positioned within a Large Quarter is ex-
haustion and unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter, leading to areversal back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point.
Consider the example in Figure 2.7, which shows the EUR/USD cur-
rency pair’s exchange rate meeting resistance at the Whole Number 1.3700in March 2009. After three unsuccessful attempts to break above the Whole
Number 1.3700, the EUR/USD currency pair moves lower. A couple of
months later in May 2009, prices move above the Large Quarter Point1.3500 in an attempt to complete the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. As

prices transition into the quarter, they approach a double-signiﬁcance
price level—the major multi-month Mid-Term Resistance Level that coin-
cides with the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point
1.3750. The failure to break above the double-signiﬁcance level (the Mid-Term Resistance/Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point
1.3750) prevents prices from advancing further, causing unsuccessful com-
pletion of the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750, and leading to exhaustion and
a reversal back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 1.3500.
Overshoots of the support/resistance levels of the Large Quarter
Points, the important price points within the Large Quarters, or the majorShort-, Mid-, or Long-Term support/resistance levels within a Large Quarter
should not be considered as decisive breakouts. Indecisive price moves of25 PIPs or less above or below support or resistance levels indicate over-
shoots and could serve as early warning signs of exhaustion and breakout
failure, leading to the unsuccessful completion of Large Quarters and re-versals back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point.
Figure 2.8 shows the AUD/USD currency pair’s exchange rate moving
above the Large Quarter Point 0.7500 in an attempt to complete the LargeQuarter 0.7500 to 0.7750. Prices make a decisive move into the Large Quar-
ter but encounter resistance at the Whole Number 0.7700 preceding the

Large Quarter Point 0.7750. There are several attempts to break above the
resistance of the Whole Number 0.7700 preceding the Large Quarter Point
0.7750; however, neither one of them produces a decisive breakout. Mul-
tiple overshoots of less than 25 PIPs above the Whole Number 0.7700 seeprices contained within the Overshoot Area/Small Quarter 0.7700 to 0.7725,
and signal indecisive price moves and exhaustion, leading to breakout fail-
ure, unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter 0.7500 to 0.7750, and a
reversal back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 0.7500.
THE THREE-DAY RULE
OF THE QUARTERS THEORY
TheThree-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory requires that a Large Quar-
ter is completed in a time period lasting no longer than three trading days.
Although price moves of 250 PIPs or more may be produced in a matter
of hours, or even minutes during highly volatile trading sessions, in mostinstances, a currency pair with an average trading range of 80 to 100 PIPs
per day would normally take at least three trading days to complete a Large
Quarter. The Quarters Theory allows three 24-hour trading sessions on theglobal foreign exchange market as a sufﬁcient time period for the com-
pletion of a Large Quarter. A failure to complete a Large Quarter in three
trading days should be considered a sign of price weakness and potential
exhaustion that could lead to the unsuccessful completion of the Large
Quarter, resulting in a reversal back toward the preceding Large QuarterPoint.
To properly monitor the Large Quarter price moves from one Large
Quarter Point to the next and the price progression along the range of eachLarge Quarter, the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory calls for the
following minimum price move requirements to be met on each one of the
three trading days that it would normally take to complete a Large Quarter:
rFirst day: Large Quarter Transition into the range of a new Large Quar-
ter conﬁrmed by a decisive price move targeting at least the End of the
Hesitation Zone. Since price pullbacks may follow each entrance into
a new Large Quarter, prices should not break above or below the pre-ceding Large Quarter Point during pullbacks.
rSecond day: Further price progression is required toward the Half
Point of the Large Quarter or toward the Whole Number precedingthe targeted Large Quarter Point. Decisive price moves on the second
day that challenge at least the Half Point of the Large Quarter would
conﬁrm a Large Quarter Transition as successful and prices shouldnot break above or below the preceding Large Quarter Point on any
pullbacks.

Forecasting the Large Quarter Price Moves 45
rThird day: Prices should successfully complete the Large Quarter. As
long as there is a number registered as a high, low, open, or close price
within one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs from the targeted Large Quarter
Point by the end of the third trading session after a Large Quarter Tran-sition, The Quarters Theory would consider a Large Quarter to be suc-
cessfully completed. If the Large Quarter is not completed by the end
of the third day, the unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter may
lead to a reversal that could take prices back toward the preceding
Large Quarter Point.
Figure 2.9 shows a Large Quarter completion in line with the require-
ments of the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory. The EUR/USD cur-rency pair’s exchange rate climbs above the Large Quarter Point 1.3750in an attempt to transition into and complete the Large Quarter 1.3750 to
1.4000. On May 20, 2009, the ﬁrst day of the entrance into the new Large
Quarter, the EUR/USD pair produces a Large Quarter Transition by mak-ing a decisive move targeting the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.3825. Not
being able to break outside of the Hesitation Zone in the ﬁrst half of the
second trading day, prices pull back toward the preceding Large Quarter

ond day since the Large Quarter Transition, prices progress further into the
Large Quarter by making a decisive move, targeting the Half Point 1.3875and the Whole Number 1.3900 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.4000.
On May 22, 2009, the third day since the Large Quarter Transition, prices
complete the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000.
Figure 2.10 is another real-life example of a successful completion of a
Large Quarter accomplished in the exact time period required by the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory. The USD/CAD currency pair’s exchangerate moves below the Large Quarter Point 1.1500 in an attempt to transition
into and complete the Large Quarter 1.1500 to 1.1250. On May 20, 2009, the
ﬁrst day of the entrance into the new Large Quarter, the USD/CAD pair pro-duces a Large Quarter Transition by making a decisive move, targeting the
End of the Hesitation Zone 1.1425 and also the Half Point 1.1375, conﬁrm-
ing the Large Quarter Transition of prices into the Large Quarter 1.1500 to1.1250. Not being able to continue further into the Large Quarter beyond
the Half Point 1.1375 in the ﬁrst half of the second trading day, prices pull

--- PAGE 65 ---

Forecasting the Large Quarter Price Moves 47
back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 1.1500 but stay below it
and remain within the Large Quarter 1.1500 to 1.1250. In the second half of
the trading session on May 21, 2009, the second day since the Large Quar-
ter Transition, prices progress further into the Large Quarter by breakingbelow the Half Point 1.1375 and targeting the Whole Number 1.1300 pre-
ceding the Large Quarter Point 1.1250. On May 22, 2009, the third day since
the Large Quarter Transition, prices break below the Whole Number 1.1300
preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.1250 and complete the Large Quarter
1.1500 to 1.1250.
Strong price moves may be capable of completing a Large Quarter in
less than three trading days. Consider the example in Figure 2.11, whichshows a Large Quarter completion in just two days. The GBP/USD currencypair’s exchange rate moves above the Large Quarter Point 1.5250 in an at-
tempt to transition into and complete the Large Quarter 1.5250 to 1.5500.
On May 18, 2009, the ﬁrst day of the entrance into the new Large Quarter,the GBP/USD pair produces a Large Quarter Transition by making a deci-
sive move, targeting the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.5325. By the end of
the ﬁrst trading session, prices pull back toward the preceding Large Quar-ter Point 1.5250 but do not break below it and remain within the new Large
Quarter 1.5250 to 1.5500. On May 19, 2009, the second day since the Large

Quarter Transition, prices make a strong move further into the Large Quar-
ter, straight through the Half Point 1.5375 and the Whole Number 1.5400
preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.5500, and complete the Large Quarter
1.5250 to 1.5500 in just two trading sessions.
While some Large Quarters may take longer than three days to com-
plete, others may end up not being completed at all even if the requiredperiod of three days were to be extended. The Quarters Theory recognizes
that allowing more than three 24-hour trading sessions does not guarantee
the successful completion of a Large Quarter. Moreover, if a Large Quarteris not completed in three days, prices may be more likely to lose steam and
may begin to hesitate to continue further into the Large Quarter by encoun-
tering support or resistance levels that could become much more difﬁcultto overcome as prices lose strength. In such instances, the Three-Day Rule
of The Quarters Theory provides the early warning signs of potential unsuc-
cessful completion of a Large Quarter that can prepare traders for possiblereversals toward a preceding Large Quarter Point.
Figure 2.12 shows the EUR/USD currency pair’s exchange rate tran-
sitioning above the Large Quarter Point 1.3500 in an attempt to completethe Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. On May 8, 2009, the ﬁrst day of the
entrance into the new Large Quarter, the EUR/USD pair conﬁrms a Large

Quarter Transition by making a decisive move, targeting the End of the
Hesitation Zone 1.3575 and the Half Point 1.3625. On the second trading
day, May 11, 2009 (after the weekend), prices pull back toward the pre-
ceding Large Quarter Point 1.3500 but ﬁnd support at the End of the Hes-itation Zone 1.3575 and remain within the new Large Quarter 1.3500 to
1.3750. On May 12, 2009, the third day since the Large Quarter Transition,
prices move toward the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter
Point 1.3750, but encounter resistance there and do not complete the Large
Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 on the third day. The fact that the Large Quar-ter is not completed within the required three-day time period sends the
ﬁrst warning sign of price weakness and potential unsuccessful comple-
tion of the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. On May 13, 2009, the fourth daysince the Large Quarter Transition, prices make several attempts to break
above the resistance of the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large
Quarter Point 1.3750 but are not capable of producing a breakout, send-ing another warning signal of price exhaustion and failure to complete the
Large Quarter in four consecutive trading sessions. The failed breakout
attempts, coupled with the unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter1.3500 to 1.3750, lead to a reversal that takes prices back toward the pre-
ceding Large Quarter Point 1.3500.
The Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory serves as a time stop.
Stops orstop-loss orders are orders to close a trade at a predetermined
price level in order to avoid or to limit losses. Stops can be set not only by
using prices, but also by time. Time stops provide a clearly deﬁned period
of time for each trade to reach its objective. If a trade does not accomplishits goal in the speciﬁed time period, the trade may be closed either to lockin proﬁts or to protect against losses or to limit them. The objective of The
Quarters Theory Trade is the successful completion of a Large Quarter. The
Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory sets a clearly deﬁned time periodof three 24-hour trading sessions on the global foreign exchange market for
each Quarters Theory Trade to reach its objective. If prices fail to complete
a Large Quarter and a Quarters Theory Trade does not achieve its goal inthe required three trading days, the trade may be closed to lock in prof-
its, or to protect against or limit losses that may be realized should prices
exhaust and reverse back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point as aresult of the unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter.

CHAPTER 3
Preparing The
Quarters Theory
Trades
The Quarters Theory Trades are based on the premise of The Quarters
Theory that currency exchange rates ﬂuctuate in an orderly mannerbetween the Large Quarter Points within each 1000 PIP Range. The
objectives of The Quarters Theory Trades are to take advantage of the sig-niﬁcant price moves in currency exchange rates from one Large QuarterPoint to another, or to capitalize on the smaller intraday price ﬂuctuations
between the important price points within each Large Quarter.
Great trades originate from great ideas, but trades should not be based
on ideas alone, no matter how great these ideas may seem. In prepara-tion for The Quarters Theory Trades, each trade idea should be carefully
examined by applying thorough analysis of all fundamental and technicalinformation available. A trade idea is not to be confused with an actual
trade: Trading opportunities should be considered only if the fundamental
and technical factors support the initial trade idea.
In the retail foreign exchange market, currencies are traded in pairs
by comparing the value of one currency against another. The ﬁrst listedcurrency in a currency pair is the base currency, or the unit that will be
compared to the second quote currency used to determine the value of the
base currency. The base currency will be stronger than the quote currencyif it takes more of the quote currency to buy one unit of the base currency.
The base currency will be weaker than the quote currency if it takes less of

supply-and-demand market forces to determine the true price value of cur-
rencies. Certain technical developments—trends and trend reversals, over-
bought/oversold market conditions, breakouts of important support and
resistance levels, and so forth—can also spark signiﬁcant price moves.These major price ﬂuctuations, triggered as the market prices into the cur-
rency exchange rates the outcome or future expectations of the market-
moving fundamental and technical events, should be used as the catalyst
and the driving force for The Quarters Theory Trades.
The Quarters Theory Trades must have a clear edge, or advantage of
one currency over the other. The preparation for each Quarters TheoryTrade should involve careful research and analysis of each one of the cur-
rencies in the currency pair that is being considered as a trading opportu-nity. The edge of each trade should be based on solid underlying fundamen-
tals and favorable technical factors. Since fundamentals usually direct the
technical developments, technicals such as trends, price patterns, techni-
cal indicators, and so forth should not contradict the underlying fundamen-tals. An environment where there is perfect alignment between fundamen-
tals and technicals is the best environment for The Quarters Theory Trade.
The chapters ahead provide information that will assist traders when
preparing The Quarters Theory Trades by applying fundamental and tech-nical analysis, combined with the methodology of the Quarters Theory.Thorough research and trade preparation improves trading performance
by reducing the element of the unknown, considered in some psychologi-
cal studies as one of the main causes of fear, and contributes to the process
of making objective trading decisions by allowing traders to gain control
over the negative impact of trading based on emotions.
DISCOVERING THE FUNDAMENTAL EDGE
To this day, in spite of severe ﬁnancial crises and economic recessions inrecent decades, the United States continues to be the largest economy in
the world and the U.S. dollar still maintains its status as the world’s main
reserve currency. Approximately two-thirds of the total foreign exchangereserves of countries around the globe are held in U.S. dollars.
The illustration in Figure 3.1, based on data from the International
Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, shows the percentage ofmajor currencies held in the world’s foreign exchange reserves from 1995
until 2005, and demonstrates the dominance of the U.S. dollar as a reserve
currency.
The story of how the U.S. dollar became the most important cur-
rency in the world dates back to the ﬁnal months of World War II, when

delegates of 44 nations led by the Big Three Allied powers—the United
States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the BritishEmpire—met in the Bretton Woods area of the U.S. town of Carroll, New
Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference. The
main focus of the conference was the rebuilding of the postwar interna-tional ﬁnancial system by creating new procedures and regulations, as well
as two new global ﬁnancial institutions—the International Monetary Fund
and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
TheBretton Woods Agreement was signed in July 1944, creating the
Bretton Woods ﬁnancial system , establishing a gold standard that required
a commitment from each country to maintain a ﬁxed value for the ex-change rate of its currency in terms of gold. Under the Bretton Woods
system, the U.S. government stepped up to offer a guarantee to other coun-
tries and their central banks that, if needed, they would be able to exchangetheir U.S. dollar reserves for gold at a ﬁxed rate. The country’s currency ex-
change rate was eventually pegged to the U.S. dollar with the perception

54 THE QUARTERS THEORY
that the U.S. dollars were “as good as gold.” This is how the world’s ﬁnan-
cial power was transferred to the United States and the U.S. dollar took
center stage as the most important currency in the world, pushing aside
the United Kingdom’s currency, the sterling.
With inﬂationary pressures rising and gold reserves running dry, the
Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1971 when the United States ceased tolet U.S. dollars be pegged and converted to gold. Currency exchange rates
were allowed to ﬂoat freely in the open foreign exchange market and, de-
spite gold’s rally from $35 to about $850 per ounce and the U.S. dollar’sconsiderable decline against other currencies in the years following the
collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. dollar continued to main-
tain its status as the world’s main reserve currency.
After World War II, the reconstruction and emergence of Germany as
an economic power helped the Deutsche mark to become the second mostimportant reserve currency in the world. The reserve currency status ofthe deutsche mark was directly transferred to the Euro with its launch as
a single currency of the Euro-zone on January 1, 1999, and since then the
Euro has become the second most powerful reserve currency in the world.
The U.S. dollar and the Euro make up approximately 90% of the global
foreign exchange reserves. Even though in recent years many countrieshave increased their purchases of Euros in order to diversify their reserves,about 64% of the global foreign exchange reserves are still held in U.S. dol-
lars, compared with approximately 30% of the total reserves held in Euros.
For 200 years, throughout the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries,
the currency of the United Kingdom, the British pound, maintained the sta-
tus of the world’s primary reserve currency. After World War II, as a resultof the gold standard, and the transfer of economic and ﬁnancial power to
the United States, Germany, and later to the Euro-zone, the pound had be-
come the third most popular reserve currency in the world, after the U.S.dollar and the Euro.
Over the past several decades, due to the resurgence of the Japanese
economy as the second-largest economy in the world, the Japanese yenhas managed to push the pound from third place as one of the main re-
serve currencies. However, in recent years, a monetary policy of extremely
low interest rates in Japan has fueled the carry trade and has caused sig-
niﬁcant Japanese yen weakness, allowing the pound to reclaim its previous
position as the third most widely held reserve currency in the world.
The strength and stability of a country’s economy and ﬁnancial mar-
kets determine its currency’s attractiveness and ability to be a reserve cur-rency. The U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound,
along with other major industrialized nations’ (Canada, Switzerland, Aus-tralia) currencies—the Canadian dollar, the Swiss franc, and the Australian
dollar—make up the list of the world’s major currencies.

When paired with each other, the major currencies form the major cur-
rency pairs, such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/CAD,
and AUD/USD. The most traded currency pairs on the spot Forex market
are: the EUR/USD pair, with 27% of total transactions; the USD/JPY, with13%; and the GBP/USD pair (also called “the cable”), with 12%. The U.S. dol-
lar has been part of over 80% of global daily foreign exchange transactions
since April 2007.
At the helm of the global ﬁnancial system are the central banks of the
world’s biggest industrialized nations. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) isthe central bank of the United States, the European Central Bank is the
central bank of the Euro-area, the Bank of England is the central bank of
the United Kingdom, and Japan’s central bank is the Bank of Japan. Othermajor central banks are the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada, and
the Reserve Bank of Australia.
The key objective of central banks is to determine monetary policies
that assure price stability and sustainable economic growth. Central banksset the ofﬁcial interest rates at which they lend to ﬁnancial institutions.
Interest rate decisions and monetary policy announcements from majorcentral banks are some of the most important economic events that every
currency trader should pay close attention to.
The interest rate, or the price of money, is a tool used by the central
banks to inﬂuence the overall economy and control inﬂation. Low interestrates normally lift the prices of assets (houses, stocks, etc.), increasing cor-
porate and individual wealth and causing more willingness to spend. Low
interest rates tend to increase economic activity and output by stimulating
consumer and corporate borrowing and spending, helping employment,new jobs creation, and economic growth. However, inﬂation can occur
if the volume of economic output grows less quickly than the actual
money spent.
Inﬂation is an increase in prices of goods and services that reduces the
value and the purchasing power of money. High inﬂation can be damagingnot only to currencies but also to the entire economy. The role of centralbanks is to protect the value of their currencies by controlling inﬂation.
The central banks in most industrialized nations prefer to contain inﬂation
in a target range around 2%. If inﬂation rises above the normal level, centralbanks can decide to raise interest rates, increase the cost of borrowing, and
slow economic growth, in order to curb rising inﬂation.
Central banks take into consideration a number of economic and ﬁnan-
cial indicators to gauge economic conditions and determine an appropriatemonetary policy. These indicators are released daily around the globe and
currency traders pay close attention to them, because positive or nega-tive changes in a country’s economic condition can have a signiﬁcant im-
pact on the exchange rate of the country’s currency. Listed below are the

--- PAGE 74 ---

c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
56 THE QUARTERS THEORY
most popular economic indicators preferred by the Fed and other major
central banks.
The Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the main gauge of eco-
nomic activity and growth, measuring the total value of goods and servicesproduced within the United States. The term real means that the output
growth is measured in real terms by removing any increases in outputcaused by inﬂation. The Real GDP, combined with employment and inﬂa-
tion data, provides an overall picture of economic conditions and trends,
and helps policymakers to determine monetary policies in order to assuresustained economic growth and price stability. The ofﬁcial GDP report is
released each quarter, but preliminary, advanced estimates are issued in
the ﬁnal week of the months immediately following the end of a calendarquarter.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the changes in prices of a
ﬁxed basket that includes typical goods and services normally purchasedby consumers. Changes in the CPI show the rate of inﬂation. The CPI is
the main gauge of inﬂation preferred by many central banks. The CPI is
released monthly and always follows the Producer Price Index (PPI).
The main measure of inﬂation in the Euro-zone is the Harmonized In-
dex of Consumer Prices (HICP). It is used by the European Central Bank asits preferred gauge of inﬂation. The HICP is the Euro-zone’s equivalent toa CPI that has been harmonized as a weighted average of changes in prices
across all member countries of the Euro-zone. The U.K. CPI also uses a
harmonized methodology to measure inﬂation across the countries of the
United Kingdom. The U.K. CPI is the main measure of inﬂation used by the
Bank of England.
The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures changes in the average sale
prices received for the output of domestic producers. The PPI measuresthe level of inﬂation experienced by manufacturers and producers, alsocalled wholesale inﬂation, which normally is passed from producers onto
the consumers. Therefore, the PPI is considered to be a leading indicatorof consumer inﬂation measured by the CPI.
Non-Farm Payrolls Employment, also known as Employment Situa-
tion, is a comprehensive report of labor market conditions, covering em-ployment, jobs creation, and unemployment rate of workers on non-farmpayrolls. Besides estimating the number of non-farm payroll jobs from
150,000 private businesses and government agencies, the employment sit-
uation report also shows the rate of unemployment, the average hourlyand weekly earnings, and the number of work hours per week. The Em-
ployment Situation report is crucial for gauging the overall condition of
the economy and is usually released on the ﬁrst Friday of each month.The Employment Situation is one of the key economic reports that have

historically proven to have the strongest potential to serve as a catalyst for
signiﬁcant market moves.
Housing Starts, Existing Home Sales, and New Home Sales are impor-
tant gauges of housing market conditions. The Housing Starts measurenew residential construction of housing units authorized to be built by a
building or zoning permit; housing units authorized to be built, but not yet
started; housing units started; housing units under construction; and hous-
ing units completed. The Existing Home Sales measure current total sales
and prices of existing single-family homes, town homes, condos, and co-ops. The Existing Home Sales are the main gauge of conditions in the res-
idential real estate market and are released on or around the twenty-ﬁfth
day of each month. The New Home Sales are a measure of the total salesand prices of newly constructed single-family homes, town homes, condos,
and co-ops. The housing market is very dependent on interest rates. The
close connection between housing wealth and consumer spending makeshousing one of the most important sectors of the economy.
Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization are gauges of conditions
in the industrial sector of the economy. Industrial Production measures thetotal output of industries like manufacturing, mining, utilities, consumer
goods, intermediate goods, business equipment, and materials. Capacity
Utilization measures the level of utilization of industrial resources. The in-dustrial sector represents approximately 20% of the Gross Domestic Prod-
uct (GDP). Changes in Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization are
useful indicators of trends in economic growth.
Retail Sales are an important gauge of consumer spending, measuring
the total sales of goods sold at retail establishments. The Retail Sales datais released monthly and does not include sales of services. Retail Sales are
a leading indicator of personal consumption expenditures.
Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), also known as Personal
Income and Outlays, measure income, expenditures, spending character-istics, and buying habits of consumers. The data is released each month
along with a very important Personal Consumption Expenditures DeﬂatorIndex, also called PCE Deﬂator, which measures price changes of a vari-
able basket of goods and services, as apposed to the CPI, which measures
the changes in prices of a ﬁxed basket that includes typical goods and ser-vices normally purchased by consumers. The PCE Deﬂator is currently the
Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inﬂation. The PCE combined with
retail sales data are key measures of consumer spending and leading indi-cators of future economic growth because approximately two-thirds of the
U.S. GDP is represented by personal consumption expenditures.
Durable Goods Orders, Shipments, and Unﬁlled Orders provide data
that track new orders, shipments, and unﬁlled orders for durable goods

--- PAGE 76 ---

c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
58 THE QUARTERS THEORY
like machinery, primary and fabricated metals, electricity-generating equip-
ment, computers and other information processing equipment, civilian and
military aircraft and ships, automobiles, and trucks and other transporta-
tion equipment. The Durable Goods Orders are an indicator of business in-vestment demand and economic conditions. An increase in durable goods
orders can lead to rising production and employment, and can stimulate
future economic growth.
The Business Sales and Inventories report measures the ratio between
total sales and existing inventories held by wholesale, retail, and manufac-turing businesses. Business Sales and Inventories are used as an indica-
tor of current and future economic conditions. Rising business inventories
coupled with declining sales can lead to cuts in production and slower eco-nomic growth.
In order to assess current and future economic conditions, central
banks and monetary policymakers also pay close attention to the followingﬁnancial indicators and factors.
rBond yields: These are yields on short- and long-term bonds issued by
the governments of major industrialized nations—U.S. Treasury bonds,
U.K. gilts, German bunds, and so forth. Government bonds, also called
government paper , are debt securities issued by governments to bor-
row funds in order to ﬁnance current and future government expen-
ditures. The bond issuer offers a predetermined rate of interest and
promises to pay back the purchaser on the day that the bond will ma-
ture.rTen-year U.S. Treasury bond yield: Closely watched by the Fed is the
yield on the ten-year U.S. Treasury bond, the current interest rate forgovernment paper maturing in ten years. Changes in the ten-year Trea-
sury bond are an indicator of moves in the long-term interest ratesthat could affect sectors of the economy that are sensitive to inter-
est rates, especially the housing sector. Mortgage interest rates often
move in conjunction with the interest rate of the ten-year Treasurybond and the relation between the two can be used to predict future
housing market activity. Higher yields could cause an increase in de-
mand from foreign investors for U.S. government bonds and other U.S.-dollar-denominated securities and ﬁnancial derivatives, which in turn
could strengthen the U.S. dollar.
rM2 money supply: The M2 money supply is a key measure of the
amount of money available in a nation’s economy. The M2 moneysupply is a combination of M1 (the total currency in circulation,
checking deposits, and traveler’s checks), plus savings deposits, less-than-$100,000 time deposits that cannot be withdrawn for a certain
period of time, and noninstitutional money market funds deposited

--- PAGE 77 ---

P1: SBT
c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
Preparing The Quarters Theory Trades 59
by individuals. The M2 money supply is used as a gauge of future in-
ﬂation and economic conditions, as increases in the supply of money
can stimulate lending and the economy but could also cause a signiﬁ-
cant rise in inﬂationary pressures.rThe Beige Book: The Beige Book is a report on economic conditions in
the 12 Federal Reserve Districts of the United States, based on anecdo-tal information gathered from reports by bank directors of the district
branches, as well as from interviews with economists, market experts,
and other sources. The Fed’s interest rate and monetary policy deci-sions are inﬂuenced by the data from the Beige Book combined with
economic and ﬁnancial indicators.
When determining the appropriate monetary policy, central banks also
keep an eye on price changes and conditions in the world’s equity mar-
kets, as measured by the main stock market indices: S&P 500, the Dow(Dow Jones Industrial Average), and NASDAQ in the United States; Nikkei
in Japan; FTSE 100 in the U.K.; Dow Jones Stoxx 50 and DJ Stoxx 600
in Europe; DAX 30 in Germany; CAC 40 in France; S&P/ASX in Australia;Hang Seng in Hong Kong; and so on. The Fed uses the S&P 500 Stock Index
as a preferred gauge of stock market performance and as a component of
the Leading Indicators of economic activity. Rising stock markets can be asign of an increase in business investment, consumer spending, and robust
economic growth.
Consumer spending plays an important role in the economic growth
of the major industrialized nations. For example, consumer spending ac-
counts for two-thirds of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product, compared withthe industrial sector, which holds only about 20% of the U.S. GDP. With
consumer spending, industrial production, and business expenditures com-
posing the majority of the GDPs of major economies around the globe,several notable consumer and business surveys are released monthly to
determine the economic situation of consumers and businesses and how
they feel about current and future economic conditions.
Consumer Conﬁdence and Consumer Sentiment are surveys of house-
holds on their personal ﬁnancial situation, their intentions to make pur-chases, and their assessment of overall conditions in the economy. Bothsurveys are not only gauges of the current views and economic situation of
consumers, but they also provide an outlook for future consumer spending
and economic trends.
There are also three popular surveys in Europe, issued by the IFO
Institute for Economic Research, the ZEW Center for European EconomicResearch, and the GfK Market Research Group, that have the potential tomove the European markets. The IFO Group Business Climate is a sur-
vey of German manufacturers and businesses on their current economic

situation and their expectations of future conditions in the German econ-
omy, which is the largest economy in the Euro-zone. The ZEW Economic
Sentiment is a survey of 350 ﬁnancial experts and analysts on their current
views and future expectations for the economic situation in Germany, theEuro-zone, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The ZEW Economic
Sentiment survey is used as a leading indicator of the German economy.
The GfK Consumer Conﬁdence is another popular monthly survey used to
gauge consumer conﬁdence in the U.K. and Germany.
In Japan, the Tankan survey is considered to be one of the most impor-
tant indicators of business sentiment. The Tankan survey questions thou-sands of large and small companies and businesses on their current eco-
nomic activity and future expectations, and is issued every quarter by theBank of Japan.
The Leading Indicators are indexes that help to predict future changes
in economic conditions in the world’s industrialized nations. The Index ofLeading Indicators in the United States includes ten economic indicators:
the yield curve (the rate spread between short- and long-term interest
rates), consumer expectations, jobless claims, average weekly workhours by manufacturing workers, M2 money supply adjusted for inﬂation,
new residential building permits, nondefense new capital goods orders,
new orders for consumer goods and materials by manufacturers, newmerchandise deliveries from suppliers to vendors, and the S&P 500 stock
market index.
Issued in the United States by the Institute for Supply Management
(ISM) are two popular surveys, the ISM Manufacturing Index and the ISM
Non-Manufacturing Index. The ISM Manufacturing Index is a monthly sur-vey of purchasing managers on economic conditions and activity in the
manufacturing sector. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index is a survey of
purchasing managers on economic activity in industries like agriculture,mining, construction, transportation, communications, wholesale trade,
and retail trade. In both, the ISM Manufacturing Index and the ISM Non-
Manufacturing Index, the level of 50 serves as the dividing line that signalseconomic contraction if the reading is below 50, or economic expansion if
the reading is above 50.
Similar to the ISM surveys in the United States are the Manufacturing
PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index), the Services PMI, and the ConstructionPMI, which measure the level of activity of purchasing managers in the
manufacturing, services, and construction sectors of the economies in theEuro-zone, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia.
Several notable indexes of economic activity are also issued in Japan.
The Tertiary Index tracks the activity and economic conditions in theservices industries: utilities, transport and telecommunications, wholesale
and retail, ﬁnance and insurance, and real estate. The All Industries Activity
Index is used to determine the level of activity in all sectors of the Japanese

economy: the services industry combined with activity in the construction,
agricultural, public, and industrial sectors of the economy.
Because of the close connection between housing wealth and con-
sumer spending, market participants tend to pay attention to indices thattrack home prices in the major industrialized nations. In the United States,
the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index tracks the monthly
changes in the average price of single-family homes in 20 metropolitan
areas. The U.S. House Price Index measures the price changes of homes
with mortgages backed by the two mortgage giants, Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac.
Several important gauges of changes in home prices and housing mar-
ket conditions in the U.K. include the RICS (Royal Institution of CharteredSurveyors) House Price Balance, the Nationwide House Price Index, the
Rightmove House Price Index, and the British Bankers’ Association Mort-
gage Approvals, used as a leading indicator of housing market activity.
Although not as crucial for central banks when determining interest
rates and monetary policy, the following economic indicators may affectcurrency exchange rates signiﬁcantly.
The International Trade Balance, also called balance of trade, mea-
sures the difference between imported and exported goods and services ina nation’s economy. Imbalances in trade can cause a trade deﬁcit when acountry imports more goods than it exports or a trade surplus if a country
exports more than it imports. Increases in a country’s exports leading to
trade surplus can cause more demand for its currency. On the other hand,
a high trade deﬁcit can weaken a country’s currency.
The TIC (Treasury International Capital) is a reporting system that
collects monthly data for cross-border investment ﬂows and positions be-tween U.S. and foreign residents. The TIC data is often used as a measure
of the attractiveness of the U.S. dollar and U.S.-dollar-denominated securi-ties and ﬁnancial derivatives for foreign investors. A similar report, called
Foreign Security Purchases, is issued in Canada as a measure of the attrac-
tiveness of the Canadian dollar for foreign investors.
An important ﬁrst step when preparing The Quarters Theory Trade is
to identify a clear fundamental edge by considering whether one currencyhas any fundamental advantage over the other in a currency pair. Carefulexamination of fundamental factors such as economic indicators, interest
rates and yield differentials, central bank policies, and geopolitical events
can reveal that the underlying fundamentals may be in favor of certain cur-rencies and may be negative for others.
A good example of how an economic indicator can affect the price
of a currency is the relationship between inﬂation and interest rates. If acountry’s main measure of inﬂation, usually the CPI, rises, higher inﬂation
can prompt a country’s central bank to raise interest rates in order to curb
inﬂation. Higher interest rates can increase the yield differential and the

--- PAGE 80 ---

P1: SBT
c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
62 THE QUARTERS THEORY
yield advantage of the currency over other lower-yielding currencies, and
could create more demand for the higher-yielding currency.
A comparison between interest rates and central bank policies in dif-
ferent countries can show signiﬁcant yield differentials between certainmajor currencies. In recent years, the Bank of Japan’s low-interest-rate
policy has been the main driver of the yen carry trade , or borrowing in
Japanese yen at very low interest rates and using the loans to buy higher-yielding assets in other countries, bringing years of Japanese yen weakness
against other higher-yielding currencies. In such an environment, consid-ering a trade that capitalizes on the negative for the Japanese yen fun-
damental factors may be a great ﬁrst step on the road to producing a
winning trade.
For many years, changes in yield differentials have created a 95% corre-
lation between the yield gap of the two-year German and U.K. governmentpaper and the EUR/GBP exchange rate. A spread of 160 basis points ad-vantage in favor of the German two-year treasuries over the similar U.K.
government paper has fueled a Euro rally by 36% against the British pound
since early 2007.
Another recent example of a major fundamental factor that could re-
veal a clear fundamental edge is the massive risk aversion and unwindingof carry trades as a result of the global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008/2009 that hasbeneﬁted lower-yielding currencies such as the Japanese yen. The ﬁnan-
cial crisis has triggered repatriation and the ﬂight to safety that has also
increased demand for the U.S. dollar because of its status as a safe-havencurrency, leading to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other cur-
rency majors.
Besides becoming familiar with the most important economic indica-
tors and their meaning, currency traders should pay attention to economicreports and prices pertaining to commodities, especially oil and gold.
Major currencies such as the Canadian, the Australian, and the New
Zealand dollar are called commodity currencies because the economies of
these countries are closely related to producing and exporting commodi-ties. Changes in commodity prices affect how the commodity currencies
are traded. For example, the Canadian dollar could strengthen if the price
of oil rises, as the Canadian economy would beneﬁt from higher energyprices because Canada is one of the main producers of oil and one of the
biggest exporters of energy in the world. Prices of metals such as gold and
copper, as well as changes in prices of agricultural products, can affect theAustralian and the New Zealand dollar because over 50% of Australia’s and
New Zealand’s exports come from the mining and agricultural sectors of
their economies.
In the process of discovering a clear fundamental edge and underly-
ing fundamentals of a currency, traders should also pay close attention to

--- PAGE 81 ---

P1: SBT
c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
Preparing The Quarters Theory Trades 63
major geopolitical events that could increase the geopolitical risk. Changes
in a country’s government, political instability, acts of war, terrorist at-
tacks, and natural disasters could have major impact on a country’s cur-
rency. Other geopolitical events include G7 industrialized nations and cen-tral bank meetings, statements and press conferences by central bank
policymakers and government ofﬁcials, and so forth.
The key role of a central bank is to maintain price stability by con-
stantly monitoring and identifying potential problems and vulnerabilities,
and taking the necessary measures to reduce risks and ensure the re-silience of its ﬁnancial system. A country’s central bank is in charge of
setting the ofﬁcial interest rates and monetary policy, controlling the sup-
ply of money, regulating the banking sector, lending money to other banks,and managing the country’s currency and assets.
Although normally considered to be a last-resort option by central
banks, a major factor that can dramatically change the underlying funda-mentals of a currency is the act of a currency market intervention. The
central bank of a country has the authority to intervene in the market
in order to increase or decrease the value of its own currency. A centralbank can also agree to participate in an organized effort with other central
banks around the world in order to inﬂuence the price of a particular
currency that may be the object of an organized intervention by multiplecentral banks.
Some examples of currency intervention include the events of Septem-
ber 16, 1992, also known as Black Wednesday, when the British govern-
ment was unable to keep the sterling above its agreed lower limit and wasforced to withdraw the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mecha-nism, leading to the collapse of the British pound. The U.K. treasury and
the Bank of England were forced to intervene by pouring in 27 billion of
currency reserves in order to support the pound. One of the biggest cur-rency investors in the world, Mr. George Soros, is famous for correctly fore-
casting these historic fundamental developments, selling short the British
pound and proﬁting over 1 billion U.S. dollars.
In June 2003, the Bank of Japan began a 15-month-long intervention
to weaken the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, in an attempt to helpthe Japanese exports and elevate the Japanese economy from 14 years ofdeﬂation. At that time, the Bank of Japan increased the supply of Japanese
yen by “printing” over 35 trillion yen, purchasing 320 billion U.S. dollars,
and investing it into U.S. Treasuries.
The Bank of Japan’s actions, described in the above example, were a
direct result of a monetary policy called quantitative easing, or creating
new money and increasing the supply of money, while at the same timeeasing the pressure on the banks caused by the risk of liquidity shortage
by providing them with excess liquidity and reserves, and stimulating bank

lending. Some quantitative easing tools used by central banks include pur-
chasing government debt, lending money to banks, and buying banks’ as-
sets. Historically, the policy of quantitative easing is perceived as negative
for currencies because increasing the supply of money can create inﬂa-tion and devalue a country’s currency. In recent years, there have been
some arguments that quantitative easing doesn’t necessarily have to be
completely negative for currencies, and that there are beneﬁts to quanti-
tative easing when it is used as a tool to create inﬂation in order to avoid
deﬂationary periods in the economy, leading to quicker economic recov-ery after prolonged recessions. In an effort to tackle the ﬁnancial melt-
down of 2008/2009, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a new monetary
policy of close to zero interest rates target band between 0% and 0.25%combined with aggressive quantitative easing that included plans to buy
up to $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries and purchasing up to $750 billion of
mortgage-backed securities in an effort to take these “toxic assets” off thebalance sheets of troubled ﬁnancial institutions. The Fed’s aggressive quan-
titative easing announcement on March 18, 2009, was met with a steep U.S.
dollar selloff. On that day, the EUR gained over 500 PIPs against the U.S.dollar in a single trading session—the biggest one-day gain for the EUR
since its inception as a currency.
In light of the recent credit crisis and economic recession, fundamen-
tal factors such as government debt and credit debt ratings of individualcountries have also impacted the exchange rates of certain currencies. Sev-
eral member countries of the European Union and some Eastern European
countries have seen their credit ratings slashed as a result of increased
risks in the ability of these countries to repay their debt, which has weighedon the Euro. Years of tensions between the United States and China on the
issue of currency manipulation and monetary policy may continue to pose
danger for the future strength of the U.S. dollar if China, the largest buyerof U.S. Treasuries, decides to signiﬁcantly reduce its purchases of U.S. gov-
ernment debt.
Understanding the current fundamental environment and identifying
a clear fundamental edge is a crucial ﬁrst step for currency traders whowould prefer not to rely solely on technical indicators when making their
trading decisions. Creating a habit of building trades based on solid under-lying fundamentals is an excellent way for traders to increase their proba-
bilities of success and generate consistent proﬁtability.
COMBINING THE QUARTERS THEORY
AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS
In the process of combining The Quarters Theory methodology with funda-
mental analysis, favorable underlying fundamentals should be discovered

and used to serve as a catalyst for signiﬁcant price moves from one Large
Quarter Point to the next, leading to the successful completion of Large
Quarters.
In spite of the common perception that fundamental analysis is only
suitable for long-term investors, the economic and geopolitical newsevents that take place daily around the world affect how the major cur-
rencies are traded in the Forex market and can produce large price ﬂuctu-
ations in a short period of time. When positive, the outcome of news events
and economic releases can increase a previously existing fundamental ad-vantage of one currency over the other in a currency pair and could accel-
erate the process of completing a Large Quarter that the currency pair may
be working on.
Economic releases or news events that have a negative outcome may
change the underlying fundamentals and tilt the advantage that one cur-rency may have in favor of the other in a currency pair. Negative for certaincurrencies, economic or geopolitical events can cause trend reversals and
could lead to unsuccessful completion of Large Quarters.
Some technical analysis traders often disregard even the basic funda-
mental research because of the tendency to believe that all fundamentaldata has already been priced into and reﬂected in the current price. When
trading currencies, however, neglecting the fundamentals when preparingfor a trade, or not being aware that important economic data may be re-
leased while holding a position, could have severe adverse effects on the
actual trade.
For the duration of each Quarters Theory Trade and while the traded
currency pair is working on completing a Large Quarter, traders shouldmake sure that any current or upcoming economic or geopolitical events
are not expected to cause changes in the underlying fundamentals.
Because of the tendency of the market to price in advance the expec-
tations for future developments, currency traders should have a clear un-derstanding not only of the current fundamental environment but also of
expectations and consensus forecasts for any upcoming economic reportsand geopolitical events.
If a certain currency pair is considered to be a trading opportunity, it is
important that the trader is aware of what economic reports are scheduledfrom the countries that the two currencies in the pair represent. Traders
should know the exact times when the upcoming economic data will be
released and should research in advance to ﬁnd out whether the issuedconsensus forecasts for the outcome of the economic reports could cause
changes in the underlying fundamentals of the currency pair.
Here are some examples of how to combine the methodology of The
Quarters Theory with fundamental analysts. Listed below are two exam-ples of potential Quarters Theory Trades based on a solid fundamental ad-
vantage of one currency over another that also uses negative forecasts and

the buildup leading to upcoming important economic reports to serve as
catalysts for the successful completion of Large Quarters.
Let us assume that a trader looking for trading opportunities notices
on Monday, February 9, 2009, that the EUR/USD pair is falling below theLarge Quarter Point at 1.3000. After careful examination of all fundamental
information available, the trader discovers that a negative market environ-
ment has triggered risk aversion, leading to the ﬂight to safety into safe-
haven currencies, increasing the demand for USD and causing the USD to
strengthen. The trader’s plan is to take advantage of further continuation ofthe down markets/risk aversion correlation by shorting the EUR/USD pair.
The trader notices several important economic reports coming up from the
Euro-zone in the next few days that could serve as catalysts for a signiﬁ-cant price move and that could lead to the successful completion of the
Large Quarter below 1.3000 toward the Large Quarter Point at 1.2750.
Considering that risk aversion is likely to occur in a down market, in
this example there is an opportunity for a Quarters Theory Trade that takesadvantage of a clear fundamental edge as long as the trader makes sure that
there will be no expected changes in underlying fundamentals for the du-ration of the trade. In this case, a trader will need to examine the economic
calendar, prepare for the upcoming important economic reports from the
Euro-zone, which could directly affect the Euro and the EUR/USD pair, an-alyze the consensus forecasts for the outcome of these economic events,
and make sure that the upcoming economic data is expected to show dete-
riorating economic conditions in the Euro-zone. The trader intends to use
the negative forecasts and the buildup leading to upcoming important eco-
nomic reports to serve as catalysts for the successful completion of theLarge Quarter toward 1.2750.
Please note in the chart in Figure 3.2 that on Monday, February 9, 2009,
the trader notices that the EUR/USD pair remains below the Large QuarterPoint at 1.3000, which, according to The Quarters Theory, is considered a
sign of weakness, and that as long as the EUR/USD pair stays below 1.3000,
there would be an increased probability that the pair will continue to workon the Large Quarter below the Large Quarter Point at 1.3000, potentially
targeting the Large Quarter Point at 1.2750. The market is expecting three
important economic reports from the Euro-zone: the Industrial Productionon Thursday, February 12, 2009; the Euro-zone GDP on Friday, February
13, 2009; and the German ZEW Business Expectations Survey on Tuesday,
February 17, 2009. Two of the reports are expected to be negative with theexception of the German ZEW survey, which is expected to show improve-
ment in the German business sentiment. The consensus forecast for the
Industrial Production expects a decline in industrial output by −2.5% m/m
(month over month) compared to the previous reading of −1.6% m/m, and
−9.5% y/y (year over year) compared to previous reading of −7.7%. The

FIGURE 3.2 Using Economic Events as Catalysts and Drivers for The Quarters

consensus forecast for the Euro-zone GDP is −1.3% q/q (quarter over quar-
ter) compared to −0.2% q/q. The only positive consensus forecast is for the
German ZEW survey, which is expected to show −27.5 compared to the
previous month’s reading of −31.0.
The actual numbers reported when the events took place showed the
Euro-zone Industrial Production at −2.6% m/m compared to the forecast of
−2.5% m/m and a previous reading of −1.6% m/m. The actual year-over-year
reading for the Euro-zone Industrial Production was also worse than ex-
pected: −12.0% y/y compared to the consensus forecast of −9.5% y/y and a
previous reading of −7.7%. The actual reading for Euro-zone GDP showed a
worse-than-expected decline in economic growth at −1.5% m/m compared
to the forecast of −1.3% q/q and a previous reading of −0.2% q/q. The ac-
tual year-over-year reading for the Euro-zone GDP was also worse than ex-
pected at −1.2% y/y compared to the consensus forecast of −1.1% y/y and
a previous reading of +0.7%. The only positive economic data as expected
was the German ZEW survey, which came up to −5.5% m/m compared to
the forecast of −27.5% m/m and a previous reading of −31.0% m/m. How-
ever, the better-than-expected month-over-month reading was offset by a
further decline in the German ZEW current conditions index to −86.2, the
weakest level since October 2003.

68 THE QUARTERS THEORY
In this example, the EUR weakens since the ﬁrst trading session of the
week, Monday, February 9, 2009, throughout the entire week as the market
prices in the negative expectations for the outcome of the upcoming eco-
nomic events: the Euro-zone Industrial Production on Thursday, February12, 2009; and the Euro-zone GDP on Friday, February 13, 2009. For the
majority of the trading week, the equity markets in the United States and
the Euro-zone trade under pressure; there is a reduction in investors’ ap-
petite for risk, triggering more risk aversion and increasing the demand for
U.S. dollars. The negative fundamental environment and the anticipationof the negative outcome of the upcoming reports (the buildup), combined
with the worse-than-expected actual outcome of the reports, accelerate the
EUR/USD pair’s downtrend and serve as a catalyst for the anticipated sig-niﬁcant price move below the Large Quarter Point at 1.3000, not only lead-
ing to the successful completion of the Large Quarter toward 1.2750, but
also pushing the EUR/USD pair even lower and leading to the successfulcompletion of another Large Quarter of 250 PIPs—the Large Quarter be-
low 1.2750 toward the Large Quarter Point at 1.2500—as the EUR/USD pair
reaches the low of 1.2513 on February 18, 2009.
Here is another example. Let us assume that it is Monday, February 9,
2009, the ﬁrst trading session of a new trading week, and we are consider-ing a potential trading opportunity with the USD/JPY pair in the days ahead.The market is expecting important news from Japan—the GDP (Gross Do-
mestic Product) on Sunday, February 15, 2009, and the Japanese Trade Bal-
ance on Tuesday, February 24, 2009. Both reports show negative consensus
forecasts: The Japanese GDP consensus forecast expects a signiﬁcant de-
cline in economic growth of −2.9% q/q (quarter over quarter) compared to a
decline of −0.5% q/q in the previous quarter. The year-over-year forecast is
also expected to be dismal, with a consensus showing −3.7% y/y compared
to a previous −0.3% y/y. The Japanese Trade Balance consensus forecast
expected another fourth consecutive month of increase in the trade deﬁcit
of−450B (billion) yen, compared to a previous reading of −320B.
Obviously, the market is expecting what could be rather dismal GDP
and Trade Balance reports coming up from Japan in the trading sessionsahead. We notice that the USD/JPY pair is at or above the Large Quarter
Point at 90.00 yen, which, according to The Quarters Theory, is considereda sign of strength, and that as long as the USD/JPY pair stays at or above
90.00, we could see the USD/JPY pair working on the Large Quarter above
the Large Quarter Point at 90.00, potentially targeting the Large QuarterPoint at 92.50. Considering that the market in the days ahead is likely to
continue pricing in the expectations for the negative outcome of the up-
coming important economic events, we see an opportunity to use this asa catalyst in order to take advantage of the buildup that could continue
to cause JPY weakness and a signiﬁcant price move that could lead to the

successful completion of the Large Quarter above 90.00 toward the Large
Quarter Point at 92.50.
The actual numbers reported when the events took place were even
worse than the forecasts. The Japanese GDP showed the Japanese econ-omy shrinking by −3.3% q/q, compared to the consensus of −2.9% q/q and
previous reading of −0.5% q/q. The year-over-year reading also came in
worse than expected at −4.6% y/y, compared to the consensus of −3.7% y/y
and previous reading of −0.3% y/y. On an annualized basis, the main gauge
of economic activity and growth, the Japanese GDP, plunged by 12.7%. Theactual Japanese Trade Balance report was also dismal. The Japanese Trade
Balance showed an actual reading of −952.6Bn, compared to the consen-
sus forecast of −450B and a previous reading of −320B. Japanese exports
declined by a record 45.7% y/y. The Japanese deﬁcit showed a new multi-year high of JPY 952.6Bn, breaking the previous record deﬁcit of 824.8Bn
yen that was set in January 1980. Exports to the United States dropped by52.9% y/y while exports to Asia shrank by 46.7% y/y. Japanese automobile
exports showed a dramatic drop by two-thirds from a year earlier.
As you will note in Figure 3.3, the negative fundamental environment
and the anticipation as the market prices in the negative outcome of theupcoming reports (the buildup), combined with the worse-than-expected
actual outcome of the reports weaken the JPY signiﬁcantly and accelerate

the USD/JPY pair’s bullish trend and serve as a catalyst for the anticipated
signiﬁcant price move above the Large Quarter Point at 90.00, not only lead-
ing to the successful completion of the Large Quarter toward 92.50, but also
contributing to the successful completion of two more Large Quarters of250 PIPs each—from the Large Quarter Point at 92.50 to the Large Quarter
Point at 95.00, and then from the Large Quarter Point at 95.00 to 97.50 yen.
The high on February 24, 2009, at 97.30 is 20 PIPs from the Large Quarter
Point at 97.50, which is a number within the vicinity of one Small Quarter
of 25 PIPs from the Large Quarter Point at 97.50—close enough to considerthe Large Quarter toward 97.50 yen to be successfully completed.
The Efﬁcient Market Hypothesis states that all known information is
already reﬂected in current prices. On the other hand, supporters of theInefﬁcient Market Hypothesis would argue that true price value cannot al-
ways be achieved because market forces in some instances cause exces-
sive price moves, leading to over- or underpricing and surpassing or com-ing short of the true price value.
Assuming that the market is efﬁcient more often than not, efﬁciency
is normally achieved when the market prices in advance the expectationsfor the outcome of all future events. It may sound like a paradox, but when
an actual economic event hits the newswires and the outcome of the event
is in line with the consensus forecasts and expectations, the event maybecome old news or simply a nonevent . Moreover, such nonevents could
trigger proﬁt-taking and signiﬁcant price moves in the opposite directionof a previously established trend. Hence the familiar saying, “Buy on the
rumor, sell on the fact.”
Of course, not all outcomes of economic data and geopolitical events
always end up being in line with expectations. Better- or worse-than-expected economic reports or unexpected geopolitical events could sur-
prise the market, leading to an increase in volatility, sometimes to extremelevels. In times like these, the market realizes its inefﬁciency and market
forces could produce large price swings as the market continues the pro-
cess of the discovery of true price value by continuing to price in the unex-pected outcome of an economic or geopolitical event.
Because of the advanced pricing tendency of the market, trading op-
portunities for a Quarters Theory Trade as described in the example aboveshould preferably be considered ahead of an important economic or geopo-
litical event, rather than trading the event at the time of its actual release.
I call this the buildup, or taking advantage of the anticipation of the event,
while market forces are still pricing the expectations of the outcome of
an event into the exchange rates of currencies. The ideal Quarters Theory
Trade is the one that achieves its objective (a successful completion of aLarge Quarter) before an important event is released. In a trade like this,
the event risk will be reduced to a minimum.

The practice of using economic releases and geopolitical events as
catalysts for a trade is also known as event-driven strategy, or in some
instances, trading based on special situations . Some most recent exam-
ples of special situations impacting currency exchange rates are the col-
lapse of Iceland’s ﬁnancial system and the risk of debt default for Russia
and other Eastern European countries as a result of the global ﬁnancial
crisis of 2008/2009.
Besides trading the buildup ahead of an event, trading the actual news
is also an event-driven strategy very popular with active traders. Althoughtrading the news may not be the preferred environment for a Quarters The-
ory Trade, big market-moving events such as interest rate announcements
from major central banks or the U.S. Non-farm Payroll Employment reportcould cause signiﬁcant price moves that could produce successful comple-
tion of Large Quarters in a short period of time. Figure 3.4 uses the historic
move in the EUR/USD pair after the FOMC monetary policy announcementon March 18, 2009. As described earlier, on that day, the Fed announced
that it would combine a monetary policy of close to zero interest rates tar-
get band between 0% and 0.25% with aggressive quantitative easing thatincluded plans to buy up to $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries and purchase
up to $750 billion of mortgage-backed securities in an effort to take these

“toxic assets” off the balance sheets of troubled ﬁnancial institutions. The
Fed’s aggressive quantitative easing announcement was met with a steep
USD selloff, and shortly after the Fed’s announcement at 2:15 P.M., ET, the
EUR/USD pair successfully completed the Large Quarter from 1.3000 to
1.3250. Immediately after that, the EUR/USD pair also completed another
second Large Quarter from 1.3250 to 1.3500.
The FOMC monetary policy announcement served as a catalyst for a
signiﬁcant price move, leading to the successful completion of two con-
secutive Large Quarters. The EUR gained over 500 PIPs against the USDin a single trading session—the biggest one-day gain for the EUR/USD pair
since the Euro’s inception as a currency.
Inexperienced traders should be careful about trading the news be-
cause of the danger of becoming a victim of the increased volatility andsometimes erratic whipsaw price swings that can trigger stops and cause
frequent losses. Although moves producing a large number of pips and suc-cessful completion of multiple Large Quarters as a result of news events
are possible, they do not occur in most instances; therefore traders should
remain conservative and realistic in their expectations. It is impossible tocompletely eliminate the event risk, because the element of the unknown
will always exist in trading. No matter how extensive the research and anal-
ysis a trader performs, there will always be the possibility that the outcomeof an event or a trade will be different than expected. However, the risk
can be managed by establishing realistic price targets, using proper stops
to limit losses, and applying proper money management.
Structuring Quarters Theory Trades based on solid underlying funda-
mentals by discovering a clear fundamental edge is a crucial ﬁrst step in theprocess of advanced trade preparation that helps mitigate risk, improves
traders’ performance, and contributes to achieving consistent proﬁtability.
In the following chapters you will ﬁnd out how to mitigate risk and increasethe odds in your favor even more by combining fundamental with technical
analysis.
IDENTIFYING THE TECHNICAL EDGE
Technical analysis plays a key role in The Quarters Theory methods fortrade preparation. By using price charts and technical indicators, traders
can identify trends, breakouts, and price patterns that may reveal a certaintechnical edge.
The opponents of technical analysis would argue that because of the
chaotic nature of the markets, price behavior is impossible to predict. Onthe other hand, some technical analysis traders believe that all fundamen-
tal data has already been priced into and reﬂected in current prices, and

--- PAGE 91 ---

P1: SBT
c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
Preparing The Quarters Theory Trades 73
therefore they would disregard any fundamental research. For The Quar-
ters Theory method of trading, the combination of fundamental and tech-
nical analysis is important for the discovery of a clear advantage of one
currency over another in a currency pair.
Thetechnicals (technical indicators) are sets of quantitative measure-
ments based on price and/or volume ﬂuctuations. There is nothing mysticalabout technical analysis—it is not a magic crystal ball and it does not offer
100% accurate prediction of the future. The technical indicators are pro-
jected into charts studied by traders, so that past price patterns are identi-ﬁed in order to gain perspective and forecast with a greater probability of
success the direction of the next price move.
In technical analysis, market data is plotted on a chart as a repre-
sentation of the changes in price over a period of time. The most ba-sic price charts, the line charts, have a simple linear representation, or
line segments connecting a series of time intervals. The open-high-low-
close (OHLC)-type charts, also called bar charts, provide more informa-
tion about the price action by showing the open, high, low, and close foreach time interval. The candlestick charts are probably the most popular
OHLC-type charts; these show the open and closing price in a rectangle,
called the body, plus the high and low prices represented by an upper and
lower shadow—the candlewick .
As shown in Figure 3.5, for each time interval, if the close price was
higher that the open price, the body of the candle would show a lighter
color (white, green, blue, etc.), indicating that the candle is bullish. On the
other hand, if the close price was lower than the open price, the body of
the candle would be in a darker color (black, red, etc.), indicating a bearishcandle. The longer the body of the candle, the bigger the bullish or bearish
price move is. The price range for the entire time interval is represented
FIGURE 3.5 Bullish and Bearish Candles

--- PAGE 92 ---

74 THE QUARTERS THEORY
by the upper and lower shadows, or candlewicks. The bottom of the lower
candlewick shows the lowest price point or the low reached during the
time interval, and the top of the upper wick shows the highest price or the
high for the time period. Sequences of several bullish or bearish candlescan reveal the direction of the trend. Shown in Figure 3.6 is a candlestick
chart where a sequence of bearish candles reveals a bearish trend, followed
by a sequence of bullish candles indicating a bullish trend.
The staple of technical analysis is the assumption that moves in prices
tend to maintain the same direction over periods of time, leading to the de-velopment of trends and trend cycles. According to the American Heritage
Dictionary , the deﬁnition of trend is: (1) a general tendency or course; (2)
a direction or movement; ﬂow. In trading, uptrends are deﬁned as a se-
quence of higher highs and higher lows registered for at least two consec-
utive time intervals. As long as the market produces a higher high and a
higher low in every new time interval as compared to the previous time in-terval, the uptrend would still be intact. However, if a bullish sequence of
consecutive higher highs and higher lows ends when the market registers a
lower high and lower low in a new time interval, a trend reversal can occurand may cause a new bearish downtrend sequence to follow. A downtrend
is a sequence of lower highs and lower lows registered for at least two con-secutive time intervals. A bearish trend sequence continues as long as themarket produces a lower high and a lower low in every new time interval

as compared to the previous time interval. As shown in Figure 3.6, traders
can visualize the direction of the trend by drawing trend lines that connect
the highs or the lows of different time intervals.
When both the highs and the lows registered in a sequence of time
intervals are connected with two parallel trend lines, traders can establishtheprice channels of a trend (see Figure 3.7). In price channels, the upper
trend line serves as a level of resistance and the lower trend line as support.Support levels are price levels that are difﬁcult to break below. Resistance
levels are certain levels at which prices may have difﬁculty overcoming andclimbing above. Channel traders normally look for opportunities to enter
long positions at lower trend line support levels and exit (or consider going
short) at upper trend line resistance.
In some instances, the market simply moves sideways without any
strongly developed up- or downtrends. In such cases, by drawing trendlines traders can identify horizontal channels indicating a trendless envi-ronment, also called range (see Figure 3.8). Horizontal channels are price
ranges that normally occur if two identical highs and a low, or two identicallows and a high, are established. Similar to up or down price channels, theupper trend line in horizontal channels is also used as resistance and the
lower trend line is considered support. Range traders usually enter long
positions at the bottom of the range and exit (or enter short positions)when resistance is reached at the top of the range.

FIGURE 3.8 Horizontal Channel
Support and resistance levels are not only helpful when trading price
channels. They are also crucial when identifying bullish or bearish break-
outs. Bullish breakouts occur when prices break above resistance levels.
Bearish breakouts (or breakdowns) occur when prices break below levelsof support. Previously broken support or resistance price levels have the
tendency to become support/resistance all over again. Most traders would
consider a resistance level that has been broken above as a potential levelof support if prices were to head lower toward the previous level of resis-
tance, which in this case will become a level of support. The same is also
valid for broken support levels when after a breakdown prices head backhigher, causing a previous support level to become a level of resistance.
Decisive bullish or bearish breakouts can produce signiﬁcant price
moves, providing great trading opportunities. The example below showsa bullish breakout leading to a strong up move with an opportunity for a
long trade as soon as the resistance level is broken. Decisive breaks below
support levels may also be considered potential short trade opportunities.A rule of thumb for many traders who trade price channel breakouts is to
use the ranges between support and resistance levels of the price channels
as guidelines when looking to establish price targets that may be reached asa result of breakouts above or below price channel support or resistance.
See Figure 3.9.

FIGURE 3.9 Channel Breakout
Traders who prefer to take advantage of trading opportunities based
on bullish and bearish breakouts should be careful not to become victims
ofhead-fakes . Head-fakes are deceptive price moves that actually have the
look and feel of genuine breakouts. Head-fakes, much as breakouts , tend
to register new highs higher than a previous resistance price or new lowprices lower than a targeted support level. The problem is that head-fakes
are not decisive breakouts and often produce insigniﬁcant price moves
that simply overshoot above resistance or below support. Such insigniﬁ-cant overshoots are quickly followed by reversals in the opposite direction
of the breakout.
Because they are difﬁcult to recognize, head-fakes remain one of the
biggest dangers for breakout traders. There are several remedies that I havefound useful that may help mitigate the negative impact of head-fakes. The
easiest way for a trader to completely avoid becoming a victim of head-fakes is simply to try not to participate in the initial attempts for a break-
out. Instead, a trader can choose to sit on the sidelines until there is a
clear indication that the breakout was indeed a decisive breakout and notjust a head-fake. In this case, a trader has to be willing to forgo some of
the proﬁts that can be made on what could be a signiﬁcant price move
during the initial breakout, in exchange for more time that may be neededfor objective observation. By doing so, a trader may be able to better assess
whether the breakout was successful without guessing the outcome while

trying to participate in the initial breakout. No matter how signiﬁcant the
price move is as a result of a decisive breakout, sooner or later there will
be a pullback that could create another opportunity for a trader to enter a
trade. Patience is a virtue in this strategy, especially considering that in alot of instances decisive breakouts above major resistance or below sup-
port levels do not occur on the ﬁrst attempt and may require additional
attempts before a decisive breakout is produced.
Here is a helpful tool that traders can utilize when trying to recognize
head-fakes. The Overshoot Rule of The Quarters Theory states that any
moves above or below an important price level (Large Quarter Points, Sup-
port or Resistance Levels, Whole Numbers) that are less than one Small
Quarter of 25 PIPs are not to be considered decisive breakouts, but rathersimple overshoots. The idea behind this rule is that insigniﬁcant price
moves, especially moves of 25 PIPs or less above or below Large Quar-
ter Points or any other important support/resistance levels, would indicatean Overshoot and not a decisive breakout.
Figure 3.10 shows a real-life example of how this simple Overshoot
Rule can be applied. The GBP/USD pair makes several attempts for abreakout above resistance at 1.4750 (which, in this case, is not only a
resistance level but also a Large Quarter Point). On the third attempt, the

resistance is ﬁnally broken. The GBP/USD pair moves above 1.4750 and
reaches a high at 1.4771—a number that is 21 PIPs above resistance at
1.4750. By applying the Overshoot Rule of The Quarters Theory, a trader
would consider this move as a simple 21 PIPs Overshoot above resistanceat 1.4750. As long as the price move does not exceed one Small Quarter of
25 PIPs, a trader would also recognize that the Overshoot does not indi-
cate a decisive breakout and would be able to prepare in advance to avoid
a powerful reversal that follows the Overshoot head-fake in this example.
In technical analysis, proper recognition of certain price patterns can
provide traders with better perspective when forecasting the direction ofthe next price move. Chart price patterns can be classiﬁed in two main
categories: trend-continuation patterns and trend-reversal patterns.
TREND-CONTINUATION PATTERNS
The most popular of the trend-continuation patterns are the triangles,
wedges, ﬂags, and pennants. The triangle chart formations include ascend-
ing, descending, and symmetrical triangles. As shown in Exhibit 3.11, thewalls of the triangles are formed by connecting the highs and the lows
reached in different time intervals with trend lines. The ﬂat wall of an

80 THE QUARTERS THEORY
ascending triangle is formed by connecting a series of identical highs with
a horizontal trend line serving as resistance. In an ascending triangle for-
mation, a rising trend line that connects a sequence of higher lows forms
the ascending wall of the triangle. Ascending triangle patterns are con-sidered as early signs of potential breakouts above the resistance of the
horizontal wall of the triangle. Ascending triangles normally occur dur-
ing periods of consolidation within a bullish trend and ascending trian-
gle breakouts often indicate a continuation of a previously established
uptrend.
The descending triangle patterns are the bearish counterparts of as-
cending triangles. The ﬂat wall of a descending triangle is formed by con-necting a series of identical lows with a horizontal trend line serving assupport. In a descending triangle formation, a falling trend line that con-
nects a sequence of lower highs forms the descending wall of the triangle.
Descending triangle patterns are considered to be early signs of potentialbreakdowns below the support of the horizontal wall of the triangle. De-
scending triangles normally occur during periods of consolidation within a
bearish trend and descending triangle breakdowns often indicate a contin-uation of a previously established downtrend.
Unlike the ascending and descending triangle formations, the symmet-
rical triangle patterns have both—an ascending and a descending wall. Thedescending wall of a symmetrical triangle is formed by connecting a series
of lower highs with a trend line serving as resistance. The ascending wall
of a symmetrical triangle is a trend line connecting a series of higher lows
serving as support. The symmetrical triangles are also considered to be
trend-continuation patterns. They are a bit more universal as compared toascending or descending triangles, because symmetrical triangles can oc-
cur not only in periods of consolidation within bullish trends but also in
periods of consolidation within bearish trends. Proper trend recognition iscrucial when preparing for the outcome of breakouts after symmetrical tri-
angle formations, because symmetrical triangle breakouts normally occur
in the direction of the previously established trend. Figure 3.12 shows areal-life example of a symmetrical triangle pattern during a period of con-
solidation within a strong positive trend, leading to a bullish breakout that
continues the previously established uptrend.
Pennant Pattern
Identical to the symmetrical triangles, the pennant chart formations are
also considered to be trend-continuation patterns. Strong trends form theﬂagpole and the pennant patterns usually occur in periods of consolida-
tion within a trend. The pennants, much as the symmetrical triangles, have
two converging ascending and descending trend lines. Bullish or bearish

FIGURE 3.12 Symmetrical Triangle Pattern
pennant breakouts normally would depend on the direction of the pre-
viously established trend. As shown in Figure 3.13, the ﬂagpole indicates
a strong bullish trend, followed by a pennant trend-consolidation pattern(similar to a symmetrical triangle), leading to a bullish breakout that con-
tinues the previously established uptrend.
Flag Pattern
Theﬂag chart patterns are similar to the pennant formations because the
direction of the trend in both is indicated by a ﬂagpole. However, unlikethe pennant formations, the ﬂag chart patterns have two parallel ascend-
ing, descending, or horizontal trend lines forming either bullish, bearish,or sideways price channels. Flag chart formations are also considered
trend-continuation patterns and normally occur in periods of consolida-
tion within a trend. Flag patterns would usually produce breakouts in thedirection of the previously established trend. Figure 3.14 shows a real-life
example of a ﬂag chart pattern during a period of consolidation within a
strong positive trend (as indicated by the uptrend ﬂagpole), leading to abullish breakout above the resistance trend line of the ﬂag that continues
the previously established uptrend.

FIGURE 3.15 Rising Wedge
Rising and Falling Wedge
Other trend-continuation price patterns, similar to the triangle chart for-
mations, are the rising or falling wedges. The rising wedge patterns are
characterized by two converging ascending trend lines connecting a se-
ries of higher highs and higher lows. Rising wedges normally occur in pe-
riods of consolidation within a bearish trend. The falling wedges have twoconverging descending trend lines connecting a series of lower highs and
lower lows. Falling wedge patterns usually form in periods of consolida-
tion within a bullish trend. Figure 3.15 shows a real-life example of a risingwedge pattern during a period of consolidation within a strong negative
trend, leading to a breakdown below the support trend line of the rising
wedge that continues the previously established downtrend.
TREND-REVERSAL PATTERNS
Chart price patterns can give traders not only an indication of potentialtrend continuation, but also some early warning signs of possible trend
reversals. The most popular trend-reversal patterns are double tops and

double bottoms, head and shoulders, rounding tops and bottoms, and cup-
and-handle formations.
Double Tops and Bottoms
Thedouble top pattern can occur when a resistance level is met within a
bullish trend, followed by a pullback in prices, then followed by a second
unsuccessful attempt to break above the previously established resistance,
leading to a sharp downward move and a possible reversal of the uptrend.Double bottoms usually take place within a bearish trend when a support
level is reached, followed by a bounce off support, and then followed bya second attempt that fails to produce a break below support. A sharp up-ward move normally occurs as a result of a double bottom, leading to a pos-
sible reversal of the downtrend. Figure 3.16 shows the USD/JPY currency
pair establishing its ﬁrst bottom when a support level is reached within astrong downtrend. A pullback in prices off support is then followed by a
second attempt to challenge and break below the previously met support.
However, the second breakdown attempt is unsuccessful, which causes adouble bottom that is quickly followed by an upward move in an attempt
to reverse the previously established downtrend.

FIGURE 3.17 Triple Top
In some instances, double tops or bottoms are followed by a third con-
secutive attempt to break double bottom support or double top resistance
levels. If such third attempts are unsuccessful, triple tops orbottoms could
occur. Triple tops or triple bottoms are also considered trend-reversal pat-
terns. Figure 3.17 shows a third consecutive unsuccessful attempt from the
USD/CAD pair to break above a strong double top resistance, leading to thedevelopment of a triple top and sharp move lower in the opposite direction
of the previously established uptrend.
Although rare, there are some instances when more unsuccessful at-
tempts to break triple bottom support or triple top resistance levels canlead to the development of quadruple tops or quadruple bottoms. Triple,
quadruple, and more tops and bottoms are also considered trend-reversalpatterns. The more unsuccessful breakout attempts are made at certain
support or resistance levels, the stronger these levels would become, and
the harder they would be to break. On the other hand, traders should keepin mind that if the market does not give up and if after each unsuccessful
attempt for a breakout there is no actual trend reversal, the more consec-
utive attempts for breakouts of such levels, the greater the probability fora successful breakout to occur sooner or later as a continuation of the
previously established trend.

FIGURE 3.18 Triple Top and Double Bottom Forming a Channel
Figure 3.18 uses the same USD/CAD chart. Please note that even after
the triple top, the pair does not completely reverse its uptrend. Support
is found for a second time at a previously established low, leading to a
double bottom, followed by a bullish move in an attempt to continue the
previous uptrend. In this example, the combination of a triple top and a
double bottom creates a well-established range. A trader who is able to
recognize these developments is likely to anticipate a move toward the topof the range that may occur as a result of the double bottom.
Head-and-Shoulders Pattern
Another popular trend-reversal pattern is the head and shoulders .T h e
head-and-shoulders pattern is a sequence of three peaks in prices withina bullish trend. The ﬁrst peak (left shoulder) is followed by a pullback thatestablishes a support level (neckline) from which another move higher
takes prices to a new, second peak (head) that is higher than the ﬁrst
one. The second peak (head) is then followed by a pullback toward thepreviously established support level reached on the pullback after the ﬁrst
peak. The trend line connecting the lows of both pullbacks is called the
neckline. When support is met, a third consecutive peak (right shoulder)follows, reaching a height identical to the height of the ﬁrst peak (left
shoulder). Once the third peak (right shoulder) is established and the pull-
back after the third peak begins, the head and shoulders pattern would be

clearly visible and traders can begin to prepare for a likely break below
the support of the neckline. The development of a head-and-shoulders pat-
tern is an early sign of potential trend reversal. Figure 3.19 shows a head-
and-shoulders pattern leading to a break below the neckline support and areversal of the previously established bullish trend.
Inverse head-and-shoulders patterns can occur within bearish trends.
They resemble a reversed head-and-shoulders formation, but instead of
three peaks in prices, the inverse head and shoulders would have three
valleys or three consecutive price drops, followed by pullbacks that would
meet resistance and establish a neckline (the trend line connecting the
highs of the pullbacks). The development of an inverse head-and-shoulders
pattern is an early sign of exhaustion and potential reversal of a previouslyestablished downtrend. Figure 3.20 shows an inverse head-and-shoulders
pattern within a strong bearish trend.
***
Even though they may not occur as often as the patterns mentioned previ-
ously, the rounding tops, rounding bottoms, and cup and handles are im-portant trend-reversal patterns that can give traders early warning signs of
exhaustion of a previously established trend and the potential for a trend
reversal.

FIGURE 3.20 Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Pattern
Rounding Top Pattern
Therounding top is a pattern that resembles an arch connecting the highs
usually reached in the ﬁnal overbought phase within a bullish trend. The
development of a rounding top is an early warning sign of exhaustion and
a possible trend reversal that may follow. The rounding bottom pattern is
a reversed version of a rounding top. Rounding bottoms usually form as
bearish trends become exhausted and can signal bearish trend reversals.
Figure 3.21 shows an uptrend that becomes extended where the highs be-
gin to form a rounding top exhaustion pattern, followed by a trend reversalof the previously established bullish trend.
Cup-and-Handle Pattern
Thecup-and-handle pattern resembles the inverse arch of a rounding bot-
tom, the cup, followed by a gentle move in price toward the bottom, form-ing a small price channel, the handle. The handle forms as a result of
a pullback when prices meet the resistance at the top of the cup. The
price channel of the handle can be either downward or horizontal, indi-cating a sideways market. The cup-and-handle pattern is usually followed
by a breakout above the upper trend line resistance of the handle’s price

TECHNICAL INDICATORS
Technical indicators are important tools of technical analysis. They areapplied to price charts in order to better identify trends, volatility, mo-mentum, and certain price patterns serving as entry and exit signals. The
technical indicators represent sets of quantitative measurements based on
price and/or volume ﬂuctuations. There are many different technical indi-cators, but in general they can be classiﬁed as leading and lagging indica-
tors. The leading indicators usually show certain price behavior or market
conditions that are used as a signal to predict future price moves. The lag-
ging indicators trail the actual price moves and are normally used to verify
trend direction and potential trend reversals. Some of the most popular and
reliable technical indicators are moving averages, MACD (moving averageconvergence/divergence), stochastics, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and
so forth.

FIGURE 3.22 Cup-and-Handle Pattern
Moving Averages
Themoving averages represent a set of average prices in different time in-
tervals. Traders can choose the amount of time intervals based on whether
they want to analyze short-, mid-, or long-term trends (e.g., 20-day, 50-day,
or 200-day periods). Depending on a trader’s preferences, moving averages
can be calculated for open, high, low, and close prices. Most commonlyused are the moving averages of closing prices. Moving averages smooth
out price ﬂuctuations and are used to better identify trends. They also serve
as support or resistance levels within trends. For example, moving aver-ages are generally considered to be support within bullish trends or resis-
tance within bearish trends. The crosses (breakouts) of the price above or
below the moving average line can be considered to be buy or sell signals.Figure 3.23 shows bullish and bearish crosses of a 20-day moving average
that can be interpreted as entry and exit signals.
Moving averages can be simple, weighted, or exponential (exponen-
tially weighted). The simple moving average is a set of average prices rep-
resented as the sum of prices divided by the total number of time intervals
chosen to be analyzed. For example, the 20-day simple moving average ofclosing prices, shown in Figure 3.23, would represent the sum of closing
prices for each day, divided by 20—the number of days over the 20-day

Average
period. When calculating moving averages, for each new time interval, old
time interval values are dropped out of the average calculation. This can
lead to a lack of proportion that causes the simple moving average to lagbehind current prices—this is why it is considered a lagging indicator.
Theweighted and exponential moving averages mitigate the lag in
simple moving averages by giving weight or more importance to prices inthe most recent time intervals. The weighted and exponential moving av-
erages are computed centrally by using both past and current data at the
time when the actual calculation takes place. Compared to the simple mov-
ing averages, the weighted and exponential moving averages would react
more quickly to price changes, leading to crosses above or below the sim-
ple moving average that some traders also prefer to use as entry or exitsignals. Figure 3.24 shows a strong bearish cross of a 20-day exponential
moving average (MAE20) below the 20-day simple moving average (MA20),
indicating potential reversal of a previously established bullish trend.
Traders use the momentum of the cross and the divergence between
actual prices and moving averages, or between two moving averages cross-ing each other, as crucial factors when determining buy or sell signals. Ingeneral, crosses with sharp momentum in prices can be used as early signs
of changes in the direction of the trend and strong signals to enter or exit

a trade. The divergence or distance between prices and a moving average,
or between two moving averages, can indicate stronger trends when there
is signiﬁcant divergence, or can give early warning signs of possible trendreversals when there is a convergence. Please note in Figure 3.25 the sharp
upward momentum after the bullish cross, as well as the signiﬁcant diver-
gence between prices and the 20-day simple moving average, indicatinga strong bullish trend. When the uptrend becomes exhausted, the conver-
gence between prices and the 20-day moving average shows the early warn-
ing signs of a potential trend reversal. The convergence is then followedby a cross below the 20-days moving average with strong downward mo-
mentum and signiﬁcant divergence between prices and the 20-day moving
average, leading to a reversal of the previously established bullish trend.
The combination of shorter- and longer-time-period moving averages is
a popular tool used by traders to generate entry and exit signals. For exam-ple, combining a 10-period moving average that would react more quicklyto price changes with a 20-period moving average can create crosses be-
tween the two that can be used as buy and sell signals. Traders should pay
close attention to the momentum of the cross and the divergence betweenthe two moving averages. Figure 3.26 shows a bullish cross of a 10-day
moving average above the 20-day moving average with a strong upward

momentum and signiﬁcant divergence between the two moving averages
that can be interpreted as a sign of a trend reversal and a buy signal. The
uptrend exhaustion is followed by a bearish cross of the 10-day moving
average below the 20-day moving average with a strong downward mo-mentum and signiﬁcant divergence between the two moving averages that
can be interpreted as a sign of reversal of the previously established bullish
trend and a sell signal.
Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indi-cator based on the combination of a shorter-time-period exponential mov-ing average and a longer-time-period exponential moving average. The
shorter-time-period exponential moving average is faster and reacts to
price changes more quickly than the longer-term exponential moving av-erage. The MACD time period settings recommended by the creator of the
MACD indicator, Gerald Appel, and most commonly used by traders are:
12-period as a faster exponential moving average and 26-period as a slowerexponential moving average. The MACD indicator also has a signal trigger
line, usually represented by a 9-day exponential moving average of the ac-tual MACD indicator that smoothes the MACD values. The MACD indicatorshows momentum and changes in the direction of the trend by subtracting
the 12-period minus the 26-period exponential moving averages and com-
paring them against the signal line of the 9-day exponential moving average
of the MACD values. When the MACD indicator shows a cross above the
signal line, traders consider it a sign of change in momentum and a buysignal. On the other hand, the MACD indicator can show a sell signal when
there is a cross below the signal line. Convergence between the lines is in-
terpreted as an early warning sign of a possible trend reversal. Figure 3.27shows bullish and bearish MACD crosses above and below the signal line,
indicating shifts in momentum and changes in the direction of the trend
that can be used as entry or exit signals.
When the MACD exponential moving averages are equal to each other,
they meet at a point called the centerline orzero-line. The centerline is an
important part of the MACD, especially when the indicator is representedin a MACD histogram. The MACD histogram shows bars that represent
the difference between the MACD and the signal line. Each bar begins at
the centerline and can be either above or below the centerline, depend-ing on the direction of the momentum and the strength of the trend. The
stronger the momentum, the longer the bars of the histogram will be. The
bars can change their direction above or below the centerline, dependingon whether there is a bullish or bearish cross between the MACD lines. In
general, if there is a reduction in the size of the bars moving closer and

FIGURE 3.27 MACD Crosses
closer toward the center line of the histogram, this can be considered an
early warning sign of a potential cross between the MACD lines that could
lead to shifts in momentum and reversals of the trend. Figure 3.28 shows
a MACD histogram that helps visualize bullish and bearish MACD crossesand trends represented as bars located above or below the zero-line of the
histogram.
There are three popular strategies to generate entry and exit signals
using MACD indicators. As explained in earlier examples, the most com-mon strategy uses crosses of the MACD above the signal line as buy trig-
gers and crosses below the signal line as sell triggers. MACD crosses abovethe zero-line can also be interpreted as buy signals, and crosses below the
zero-line as sell signals. The third most popular strategy capitalizes on the
divergence, or the differences, between the actual prices and MACD in-dicator, or divergence between prices and the MACD histogram. Positive
divergence can occur within a bearish trend when actual prices continue
to produce new lows, but the MACD indicator remains at previous levelsand does not move lower. Traders usually interpret such positive diver-
gence between prices and the MACD indicator as an early sign of exhaus-
tion of the bearish trend and a potential shift in momentum to the upside.Negative divergence can develop within bullish trends when actual prices
continue to make higher highs; however, the MACD indicator remains at

lower levels and does not follow prices any higher. Traders who spot
negative divergence between actual prices and the MACD indicator may
use it as an early sell signal based on the expectation that the bullish
trend may exhaust, leading to a shift in momentum to the downside.The same positive and negative divergences can occur between actual
prices and the MACD histogram. Figure 3.29 shows positive divergence
within a strong bearish trend. Please note that the actual prices con-tinue to produce new lows as the bearish trend lasts from approximately
June 1998 until January 2001. However, since January 2000, the bars of the
MACD histogram no longer follow the lower prices. Despite the new lowsin prices, the bars of the MACD histogram begin to shrink in size and get
closer and closer to the zero-line, and at the lowest point in prices, the bars
of the MACD histogram are actually almost at the zero-line. In Figure 3.29,there is a positive divergence between prices and the MACD histogram
from approximately January until December 2000 that can be interpreted
as an early sign of trend exhaustion that leads to shift in momentum to theupside and a reversal of the previously established multiyear bearish trend.
As shown in the previous example, positive/negative divergences can
serve as leading indicators of trend reversals. However, despite techni-cal improvements made to moving averages throughout the years and the
addition of the MACD histogram, moving averages and MACD are still

FIGURE 3.29 MACD Histogram Positive Divergence
considered to be lagging indicators that trail actual prices. This means that
moves in prices may take a while to be conﬁrmed by the moving averages
or MACD; therefore, it may be necessary to wait several time periods or
wait for price pullbacks before entering trades based on the moving aver-ages or MACD crossover signals. For example, one strategy suggests con-
ﬁrming bullish MACD crossovers by waiting to see whether the MACD line
stays above the signal line for least three time intervals after the crossoverbefore entering the trade at the end of the third time interval. Traders
should remember to conﬁrm moving averages and MACD signals with ac-
tual movements in prices, as well as with signals from other technical indi-cators, such as the stochastic oscillator and Relative Strength Index.
Stochastic Oscillator
Thestochastic oscillator and the Relative Strength Index are two of the
most popular technical indicators. They are called oscillators because they
move within a range, usually between 0 and 100. The stochastic oscillator
is a momentum indicator that compares prices within a speciﬁc period of
time. Traders can chose the amount of time intervals to be analyzed as wellas the type of prices: open, high, low, or close prices. Most commonly used
are the stochastic oscillators of closing prices. The stochastic oscillators

FIGURE 3.30 Fast and Slow Stochastic Oscillators
can be fast or slow. The fast and the slow stochastic oscillators have a
shorter-time-period exponential moving averages %K line, and a longer-
time-period exponential moving averages %D line, which is an exponential
moving average of the %K. The shorter-time-period exponential moving av-erage %K is faster and reacts to price changes quicker than the longer-term
exponential moving average %D. As with the MACD indicator, the fast and
slow stochastics also have a signal line that is represented by the %D expo-nential moving average, and crosses above or below the signal line %D are
used as entry or exit signals. The slow stochastic oscillator is usually pre-
ferred because it is smoother (see Figure 3.30) and shows fewer crosses ofthe signal line, compared to the fast stochastic oscillator, which can show
erratic price moves and more frequent crosses that in some instances may
produce false entry/exit signals. Both the fast and the slow stochastics os-cillate in a range between 0 and 100. When there is a strong bullish trend,
prices should move toward the top of the range, and within strong bear-
ish trends, prices should move toward the bottom of the range. However,if the stochastic oscillator shows a reading above 80, this indicates over-
bought conditions, which is normally interpreted as an early warning sign
of a bullish trend exhaustion and potential reversal. On the other hand,a reading below 20 indicates oversold conditions as a sign of potential
exhaustion and reversal of a bearish trend.

FIGURE 3.31 Entry and Exit Signals Shown by Stochastic Oscillator
There are several ways to generate entry and exit signals using the
stochastic oscillator. Traders can monitor the indicator for crosses above
the %D signal line, which indicate a shift in momentum to the upside and
can be interpreted as buy triggers. Crosses below the %D signal line indi-cate a shift in momentum to the downside and can be used as sell signals.
This strategy can be a bit problematic in a volatile trading environment,
when crosses can develop very frequently and some of the frequent crossesmay produce fake entry/exit signals followed by quick reversals that can
trigger stops and cause losses. Therefore, some experienced traders tend
to wait until the crosses above the %D signal line are accompanied by across above the 20 mark of the stochastic oscillator, which indicates over-
sold conditions and a potential exhaustion and reversal of a bearish trend,
as well as waiting until a cross below the signal line is accompanied by across below the 80 mark of the stochastic oscillator, which would indicate
a potential exhaustion and reversal of a bullish trend (see Figure 3.31).
A popular strategy when using the stochastic oscillator is to take ad-
vantage of divergence, or the difference between actual prices and thestochastic oscillator. Divergence can occur when prices trend in the op-
posite direction from that of the stochastic oscillator. Such divergencesare normally considered to be early signs of extended overbought/oversold
trends that may soon be followed by a trend reversal. The following

example shows divergence between actual prices and a slow stochastic
oscillator. Please note in Figure 3.32 that the bullish trend in prices contin-ues until approximately 01/01/09. However, on 12/17/09, almost two weeks
earlier, the slow stochastic oscillator gives an early trend-reversal sign with
a bearish cross below %D and also a cross below 80. In this example, the
divergence between actual prices and the stochastic oscillator, along with
the bearish cross below %D and below 80, may be considered an early sellsignal based on the expectation that the bullish trend is overbought and
may soon exhaust, leading to a shift in momentum to the downside and a
potential reversal of the previously established bullish trend.
Relative Strength Index
TheRelative Strength Index (RSI) is another popular technical indicator
similar to the stochastic oscillator. The RSI determines the strength of pricemoves by comparing up and down price changes from the time of closingof the previous trading session until the close of the following day’s trad-
ing session. The recommended minimum period to be analyzed is usually
14 days, although traders can customize the indicator for longer or shortertime periods. The RSI also oscillates in a range between 0 and 100. A Rela-
tive Strength Index reading above 70 indicates overbought conditions and

FIGURE 3.33 Relative Strength Index
may be interpreted as an early warning sign of an extended bullish trend
that may be followed by exhaustion and potential trend reversal. On the
other hand, an RSI reading below 30 indicates oversold conditions as asign of potential exhaustion and reversal of an extended bearish trend (see
Figure 3.33).
As shown in Figure 3.33, bearish RSI crosses below 70 show shifts in
momentum to the downside and can be used as early signs of potential re-versal of overbought bullish trends. Bullish crosses above 30 show shifts
in momentum to the upside and can be used as early warning signs of po-tential reversal of oversold bearish trends. Big up or down price spikes can
easily push the RSI above or below the 30 and 70 marks, and may cause
false buy or sell signals. Therefore, traders should remember that the RSImight not be best used as a standalone buy/sell signal indicator. The Rela-
tive Strength Index is mainly a momentum and trend-conﬁrmation tool, and
is recommended to be used in conjunction with other technical indicators.
FIBONACCI RETRACEMENT
In his book, Liber Abaci (The Book of Calculation), one of the most tal-
ented mathematicians of the Middle Ages, Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci,

--- PAGE 120 ---

102 THE QUARTERS THEORY
ﬁrst introduced the beneﬁts of the Hindu–Arabic 0 to 9 numeral system to
Europe and the western world. Besides explaining the practical advantages
of this “new” numeral system, Fibonacci’s book explained a sequence of
numbers used for centuries by mathematicians in India that is now knownas the Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence of numbers begins
with the numbers 0 and 1, and each new number is the sum of the previoustwo numbers:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144, 233, 377...
As the sequence grows and the numbers become larger, they approach
theGolden Ratio, where each number divided by the number that precedes
it (for example, 89/55) will have a constant value of approximately 1.618,
and each number divided by the number that succeeds it (for example,
55/89) will also have a constant value of 0.618. When a number is skipped,for example, if we skip 89 and divide 144/55, the value will be a constant
2.618; and if we were to skip a number, for example, 89, and divide 55 by
the next number 144 that follows 89 in the sequence, the value will be aconstant 0.382. In the Fibonacci series of numbers, when the golden ra-
tio is reached, the growth ratio in the sequence will be 1.618 and we can
determine the next number by multiplying Ntimes 1.618. If a line X is di-
vided by 1.618, the division, called the golden section, will produce two
lengths: 0.618X and 0.382X. The Fibonacci sequence can be found in na-ture as many animals and plants reproduce and grow in harmony with the
golden ratio growth function. The Fibonacci golden ratio and the golden
section division continue to fascinate modern mathematicians, scientists,astronomers, and artists.
Traders also have found some practical applications of the Fibonacci
sequence and golden ratio, the most popular of which is the use of theFibonacci retracement measures . The Fibonacci retracement levels are
determined by using the Fibonacci ratios to calculate 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%,61.8%, and 100% retracements of any pullbacks in prices during periodsof consolidation. These measures of retracement percentages are based
on previously established price ranges between highs and lows. The Fi-
bonacci retracement levels help traders to identify important price pointsthat may serve as support/resistance levels during pullbacks. If prices
ﬁnd support/resistance at certain Fibonacci retracement levels, there is a
strong probability that the previously established trends may continue fur-ther. Traders use the Fibonacci retracement levels as a strategic tool to
determine price targets that may be reached while prices pull back in peri-
ods of consolidation, to set stops, and to generate entry/exit signals.
Figure 3.34 shows a pullback in prices as the USD/JPY pair con-
solidates within a strong bullish trend. Once traders determine that the

consolidation has begun, they can calculate the Fibonacci retracement per-
centages based on the price range represented by the total number of PIPsproduced from the lowest to the highest price point registered during the
entire bullish trend’s price move. The two trend lines running through the
lowest and the highest points deﬁne the range. In consolidations occurringwithin bullish trends, the 0% retracement will be the level of the highest
price point and the 100% retracement will be the level of the lowest price
point. The 0% retracement within bearish trend consolidations will be thelevel of the lowest price point and the 100% retracement will be the level of
the highest price point. The distance between 0% and 100% is divided using
the Fibonacci ratios to determine 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% Fibonacciretracement levels.
Some popular trading strategies are based on using Fibonacci retrace-
ment levels. As a countertrend strategy, traders may take advantage ofprice pullbacks in the opposite direction of previously established trends.
Countertrend traders use the Fibonacci retracement levels as price tar-
gets that may be reached during consolidations. A trend-continuation strat-egy can be utilized if a Fibonacci retracement level establishes itself as a
strong level of support or resistance, providing opportunities for traders

to take advantage of the potential for further continuation of previously
established trends.
Figure 3.35 shows a countertrend short trade based on the pullback in
price occurring during a consolidation within a strong uptrend. Conserva-tive proﬁt targets may be placed at price points a few PIPs before either
the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels are reached. Asking for“perfect” 50% or 61.8% retracements might be a bit more aggressive of an
approach, as such larger retracements might be more difﬁcult to accom-
plish consistently. In this example of a countertrend trade, stops can beplaced above the 0% retracement level (the highest price point).
As shown in Figure 3.35, if strong support is found above the 50% or
61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels, the consolidation may end and thiscould create an opportunity for a long trade based on the expectation for
further continuation of the previously established uptrend. In this exam-
ple of a trend-continuation trade, stops can be placed below either the 50%or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels. A more conservative proﬁt target
could be the previous high that may be challenged as a resistance level
in an attempt to continue the previously established bullish trend. Traderswho are convinced that there will be a successful breakout above the re-
sistance of the highest point and that the uptrend will continue further can

place proﬁt targets based on other resistance levels or may use Fibonacci
extensions to determine how far the trend may extend if the breakout is
successful.
FIBONACCI EXTENSIONS
Fibonacci extensions are used as a technical analysis tool to determine
potential support/resistance levels that may be challenged if previously es-tablished trends continue as a result of successful breakouts. Since certain
trend-continuation chart patterns such as ascending or descending tri-angles can show early signs of potential breakouts, traders often apply
Fibonacci extensions to see how far previous trends could continue if
trend-continuation pattern breakouts were successful. The Fibonacci ex-tensions are based on the 1.618 golden ratio. The Fibonacci extension be-
yond 100% will be 161.8%, and the Fibonacci extension beyond 200% will
be 261.8%. These 161.8% and 261.8% Fibonacci extension levels are used todetermine future support or resistance.

dates within a strong bullish trend. The two trend lines running through

the lowest and the highest price points deﬁne the range of the uptrend.
The 0% level is represented by the lowest price point and the 100% level
is the highest price point of the bullish trend. Traders who anticipate that
the uptrend may continue after the price pullback/consolidation ends candetermine future resistance levels by using Fibonacci extensions. In this
example, the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level may serve as the next resis-
tance level if the bullish trend continues further as a result of a successful
breakout above the 100% level resistance of the highest point.
ELLIOTT WAVES
Since the late 1930s, when Ralph Nelson Elliott published The Wave Prin-
ciple,t h eElliott Waves have remained one of the best tools used by traders
to identify trend cycles and patterns.
There is a connection between the Elliott Wave Theory and fractals in
mathematical science. A fractal is an object or quantity that displays self-
similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales. The object need
not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same type of
structures must appear on all scales (Eric W. Weisstein, “Fractal,” fromMathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Fractal.html).
Fractal mathematical structures repeat themselves on smaller scales.
The pictures in Figure 3.37 show fractals known as the Gosper Island,
Koch Snowﬂake, Box Fractal, Sierpi ´nski Triangle, Barnsley’s Fern, Dragon
Curve, and Mandelbrot Set.
The rhythm of repetition of patterns and cycles in nature led Elliott to
propose that human behavior also has rhythmical cycles and that future
human behavior can be predicted based on the repetition of such cycles.He was able to look beyond the perception of the chaotic nature of the
ﬁnancial markets and discovered the repetition of market cycles based on
optimistic and pessimistic patterns of human behavior. Elliott divided theﬁnancial market cycles into fractional patterns, called waves.
Elliott gave the main trend the name impulse wave cycle and divided
it into a pattern consisting of ﬁve smaller waves. Each impulse wave cycleis followed by a corrective wave cycle consisting of three smaller waves.
The perfect Elliott Wave pattern has impulsive and corrective cycles con-sisting of eight waves: three motive waves 1, 3, and 5 up in the direction
of the main trend, and three corrective waves 2 and 4 down, followed by a
corrective wave cycle that has two motive waves A and C down, and onecorrective wave B up (see Figure 3.38).
The same pattern applies when the main trend is bearish. In a bear mar-
ket, the impulse trend cycle would consist of three motive waves 1, 3 and

5 down in the direction of the main trend and three corrective waves 2 and
4 up, followed by a corrective wave cycle that has two motive waves A and
C up, and one corrective wave B down.
Figure 3.39 shows a real-life example of an Elliott Wave pattern within
a bullish trend in the USD/JPY currency pair.
Each wave in the Elliott Wave pattern has its own distinctive features:
rWave 1 may be difﬁcult to recognize as it normally begins when a pre-
viously established trend is still intact and the sentiment among in-
vestors is predominantly bearish.rWave 2 is a corrective wave to Wave 1. Because sentiment during Wave
2 is still bearish, prices may even retest the previous low point of Wave1, but Wave 2 should not register a lower low than the low of Wave 1
and should not have longer length than Wave 1.
rWave 3 is usually the strongest and largest wave in the pattern. Investor
sentiment normally turns more and more positive during Wave 3 andprices rise fast. By the middle of Wave 3, the majority of market par-
ticipants have realized that a strong bullish trend has been establishedand they jump in on the action, driving prices higher and extending the
length of the wave.

--- PAGE 127 ---

P1: SBT
c03 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:56 Printer: Yet to come
Preparing The Quarters Theory Trades 109
rWave 4 is the corrective wave to Wave 3. The pullback in price during
Wave 4 may not be as signiﬁcant as the pullback in Wave 2, in many
instances not larger than 50% of Wave 3, because many traders who
expect the trend to continue look for opportunities to take advantageof the pullback in anticipation of Wave 5.
rWave 5 is usually the ﬁnal stage of the main trend. By the time Wave
5 develops, even the most inexperienced investors have ﬁnally noticed
the strong trend and decide to participate in it, often buying at the top
or selling at the bottom, and ending up with a loss because of the sig-niﬁcant price correction that usually follows Wave 5.
rWave A is the ﬁrst wave of the countertrend corrective pattern. Wave
A begins as a corrective wave to Wave 5. Because the sentiment is stillpredominantly bullish, Wave A may not register a lower low than the
low of Wave 4, but it may test the low of Wave 4, establish a double
bottom, and lead to a push higher with Wave B.
rWave B may seem to many market participants as an attempt to con-
tinue the previously established trend; however, the bullish investorsentiment may become increasingly more bearish. If the high of WaveB is identical to, and not higher than, the high of Wave 5, traders may
recognize this development as a double top trend-reversal pattern. If
the high reached during Wave B is identical to the high of Wave 3, manymay recognize Wave B as the right shoulder of a head-and-shoulders
formation that could be the ﬁrst sign of potential trend reversal, lead-
ing to Wave C.
rWave C is an attempt to reverse the previously established trend. By
the middle of Wave C, most market participants have already identi-ﬁed the shift in momentum and have decided to participate in the new
bearish trend, pushing Wave C farther than Wave A. If Wave C does not
completely reverse the previously established trend, another sequenceof impulsive waves could follow.
According to Elliott, these ﬁve- and three-wave patterns can repeat
themselves, forming a complete cycle of 89 impulse waves and 55 correc-
tive waves that actually develop in close connection with the Fibonacci
growth ratio. Although when Elliott ﬁrst discovered the Wave Princi-
pleof market trends he claimed, “I’ve never heard of the Fibonacci se-
ries,” later when he analyzed the waves from a mathematical standpoint,Elliott came to the conclusion that “The Fibonacci Series is the basis ofThe Wave Principle.” The Fibonacci series of numbers is evident in the
1, 3, 5 impulsive waves, the pattern of 5 waves up and 3 waves down for
a total of 8 waves—the following number after 3 and 5 in the Fibonaccisequence—and also the complete cycle of 89 impulse and 55 corrective
waves growing by the 1.618 Fibonacci growth ratio from 55 ×1.618=88.99,

--- PAGE 128 ---

P1: SBT

110 THE QUARTERS THEORY
to approximately 89 impulse waves, then followed by 89/1.618 =55.00, to
55 corrective waves, and so forth.
The Fibonacci retracement is an important tool for traders who fol-
low Elliott Wave patterns. Since pullbacks in price normally occur within
the corrective waves of the pattern, many traders use the Fibonacci re-
tracements in order to identify future support/resistance levels at which
a corrective wave may end. If prices ﬁnd support/resistance at certain
Fibonacci retracement levels, there is a good probability that the price pull-
back of the corrective wave may be over and another impulse wave maydevelop, continuing the previously established trend. Traders may look for
countertrend opportunities within corrective waves using the Fibonacci
retracements to determine price targets that may be reached while pricespull back. Fibonacci retracement levels are also used to generate entry/exit
signals and to set protective stops.
Let us consider the following examples of different strategies using
Fibonacci retracements within Elliot Wave patterns. The chart in Fig-ure 3.40 shows a countertrend short trade based on the pullback in price
occurring within a corrective Wave 2. A conservative proﬁt target may beplaced at price points a few PIPs before either the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci
retracement levels are reached. Wave 2 is a corrective wave to Wave 1, and,
because sentiment during Wave 2 is still predominantly bearish, larger re-tracements are possible during Wave 2 and prices may even retest the pre-
vious low of Wave 1. However, asking for larger 50% or 61.8% retracements
or complete 100% retracements might be a bit more aggressive of an ap-
proach, as such larger retracements might be more difﬁcult to accomplish
consistently. In this example of a countertrend trade, stops can be placedabove the 0% retracement level, which is the high of Wave 1.
As shown in Figure 3.40, if strong support is found above the 38.2%,
50%, or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels, Wave 2 may end and this couldcreate an opportunity for a long trade based on the anticipation of further
continuation of the previously established uptrend with Wave 3. In this ex-
ample, there is also an opportunity for a trend-continuation trade. Depend-ing on the size of the pullback, the 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8% Fibonacci
retracement levels may be used as entry points for trend-continuation
trades and protective stops can be placed below the 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8%Fibonacci retracement levels. A more conservative proﬁt target could be
the high of Wave 1, which may be challenged as a resistance level in an
attempt to continue the previously established bullish trend. Traders whoanticipate that there will be a successful breakout above the high of Wave 1
and that the uptrend will continue further with Wave 3 can place proﬁt tar-
gets based on previous resistance levels above the high of Wave 1 or mayuse the 161.8% Fibonacci extension of Wave 1 to determine approximately
how far the trend might extend if Wave 3 were successful (see Figure 3.41).

CHAPTER 4
The Quarters
Theory Trend
Waves
One of the main problems of the classic Elliott Wave Theory is sub-
jectivity. When Elliott Wave technical analysts are asked to collec-tively determine the number of waves in a trend cycle and give their
prediction of future price moves, it is not unusual for them to have contra-dicting views. The reason for that in most instances is the subjective inter-pretation when the waves in each cycle are counted. To this day, proper
wave count is considered to be the most challenging issue for Elliott Wave
traders.
Consider the following scenario. Let us assume that a trader is under
the impression that she is trading uptrend Wave 3, the strongest wave inthe classic Elliott wave pattern, anticipating a signiﬁcant price move, whenin actuality she is trading Wave 5, which normally is limited and is the last
wave in the bullish impulse cycle. Let us say the trader gets lucky this one
time—Wave 5 extends longer than usual and the trader makes a winning
trade. What happens if after the corrective wave she enters a long trade
again, expecting the trend to continue further with another bullish Wave 5,only to ﬁnd that a corrective wave pattern has begun, producing Wave A
instead of Wave 5? In this case, the trader will likely end up with a losing
trade. Had she actually counted the trend waves properly, she would havebeen able to determine the exact phase of the trend progression and as
a result would have made a better trading decision and an unnecessary
losing trade would have been easily avoided. Losing trades will always bepart of trading, but losing trades due to pure ignorance or negligence are
absolutely unnecessary. We should try our best to avoid unnecessary losses

116 THE QUARTERS THEORY
because they can hurt our bottom line by tilting the scale between winning
and losing trades.
Some experts favor the notion that proper wave count is not crucial
as long as a trader correctly identiﬁes the direction of the trend and thenuses proper stops and realistic proﬁt targets. This is a valid point, because
the element of the unknown will always exist in trading. Even if one knows
the proper wave count, that still does not guarantee that the trend will de-
velop exactly, according to the classic Elliott Wave pattern. No one can
predict the outcome of future events with 100% success. But is avoidingthe problem of proper wave count the best way to deal with it? Having
experienced the tremendous beneﬁts associated with understanding the
different stages of trend progression, I have decided to tackle the issue bydeveloping a proprietary method of counting trend waves, which, for lack
of a better name, I call The Quarters Theory Trend Waves. The method
follows a strict set of rules and procedures, and as with The Quarters The-
ory, uses the most important units of information for every trader—the
actual prices.
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves combine the premise of the Elliott
Wave Theory with the premise of the Dow Theory, which deﬁnes the three-
trend market and divides the primary trend into three phases.T h e ideal
Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle has three phases, consisting of trend
waves numbered 1, 2, and 3. They are identical to the impulse cycle waves
1, 3, and 5 in the classic Elliott Wave Theory. However, The Quarters The-
ory Trend Waves cycle has a different numerical representation, because
the classic Elliott Wave Theory corrective waves 2 and 4 are simply given
the name Correction rather than the numbers 2 and 4. Each Correction oc-
curs after the end of either trend wave 1, 2, or 3, and in the examples that
follow you will see the corrections noted as C1, C2, or C3, so that traders
would know the actual trend wave that each Correction follows. This pro-vides continuity in the process of counting actual trend waves 1, 2, and 3,
without skipping a number with waves 1, 3, and 5, which is the practice in
the classic Elliott Wave principle. The reduction in wave count also helpstraders to better recognize and focus on the waves that actually progress
the trend, not regress it.
In order to identify the different stages of trend development, I have
chosen to give The Quarters Theory Trend Waves the following namesbased on the individual characteristics of each trend wave:
rReversal-Trigger Wave 1 marks the beginning of each new trend cy-
cle. I call it the Reversal-Trigger wave because it normally occurs as
an attempt to reverse a previously established trend. This trend wave
can trigger not only a corrective trend pattern, but it could be the

The Quarters Theory Trend Waves 117
beginning phase of a complete trend reversal, especially if it is followed
by a Progressive Wave 2.rProgressive Wave 2 is the trend wave that extends the trend and “pro-
gresses” it further. This is the equivalent to Wave 3 in the classic ElliottWave principle.
rConclusive Wave 3 is expected to signal the ﬁnal phase in the trend
cycle. The Conclusive Wave 3 is the equivalent to Wave 5 in the classic
Elliott Wave principle. The Conclusive Wave 3 may be shorter in length
compared to the other trend waves and price moves may be limited.
In a bullish trend wave cycle, each new trend wave will have to pro-
duce a higher high than the high of the previous trend wave and the lowof each Correction will have to remain at or above the low of the preced-
ing trend wave. In a bearish trend wave cycle, each new trend wave will
have to produce a lower low than the low of the previous trend wave andthe high of each Correction will have to remain at or below the high of the
preceding trend wave.
Figure 4.1 shows an ideal bullish Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle
consisting of Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, followed by Correction 1; Progres-sive Wave 2, followed by Correction 2; and Conclusive Wave 3, followed by
Correction 3.
Note that in the ideal Quarters Theory Trend Waves pattern there are
no corrective waves A, B, and C. The Quarters Theory Trend Waves methodleaves future possibilities open and lets the market indicate whether it

wants to reverse the previously established trend or simply continue it fur-
ther. The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method anticipates that the Con-
clusive Wave 3 may be the ﬁnal phase of the trend cycle. But as long as the
Correction following the Conclusive Wave 3 does not produce a lower lowthan the low of Wave 3, the bullish trend sequence could continue with an
attempt for another consecutive bullish Wave 4. If the Consecutive Wave
4 produces a higher high than the high of Wave 3, the bullish trend will
progress further. As long as the Correction following Wave 4 remains at
or above the low of Wave 4, there may even be an attempt to continue thebullish trend with another consecutive Wave 5. Although this scenario does
not occur very often, we should not ignore the possibility that more than
three trend waves could develop, especially in instances when the maintrend is very strong.
Each new trend wave that follows an ideal sequence of three Quarters
Theory Trend Waves is given the name Consecutive Wave,f o l l o w e db yt h e
number 4 or 5, and so on. Figure 4.2 shows a real-life example of an Ex-
tended Quarters Theory Trend Wave sequence. The bearish trend waves
in the beginning of the chart are followed by a strong bullish trend wavesequence, where the Conclusive Wave 3 is followed by two more trend
waves—Consecutive Wave 4 and Consecutive Wave 5.

TREND WAVE FAILURE
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycles can be ideal (consisting of a
perfect three-trend wave pattern), extended (having more than three trend
waves), or in some instances, short (consisting of less than an ideal pattern
of three trend waves). Trend wave cycles usually end as a result of an event
called Trend Wave Failure. To understand the causes of Trend Wave Fail-
ure, one needs to follow the basic deﬁnitions of uptrend anddowntrend.
An uptrend is a sequence of higher highs, and a downtrend is a sequence
of lower lows. Bullish trends are likely to fail to continue further if eachnew high is lower than a previous high. On the other hand, bearish trends
would fail if each new low is actually higher than a previous low.
Trend Wave Failure can be easily recognized as long as traders pay
close attention to prices. A bullish trend wave cycle would continue toprogress the uptrend further as long as each new trend wave produces a
new high that is higher than the previous trend wave’s high. Bearish trendwave cycles would continue further as long as each new bearish trend wave
is successful in producing a lower low than the low of the previous trend
wave. Trend Wave Failure occurs either when a follow-up bullish trendwave fails to register a higher high than the high of a preceding bullish
trend wave, or when a bearish trend wave fails to produce a lower low than
the low of a preceding bearish trend wave in the sequence. The unsuccess-ful trend progression as a result of a Trend Wave Failure usually leads to
an attempt for a trend reversal with the development of a Reversal-Trigger
Wave in the opposite direction of the previously established trend. This is
the main consequence of a Trend Wave Failure.
Figure 4.3 shows a short trend wave cycle consisting of two trend
waves: an extended bullish Wave 1, followed by an attempt to continuethe bullish trend sequence with a Progressive Wave 2. Note that Wave 2
fails to produce a higher high than the high of Wave 1. The bullish trendwave sequence ends and as a result of the Trend Wave Failure of Wave 2,
a Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 develops in the opposite direction of the bullish
trend waves in an attempt to reverse the uptrend.
No individual trend wave in a trend cycle is immune from the danger of
failing; therefore, traders should monitor each wave carefully and shouldwatch for signs that may signal Trend Wave Failure. Some helpful earlywarning signs of Trend Wave Failure may be given by certain trend-reversal
patterns, especially double tops, double bottoms, or head-and-shoulder
formations.
Let us analyze the trend developments throughout the entire chart
used in the previous example. As you will note on the left-hand side ofFigure 4.4, the perfect three bearish trend waves are followed by an

attempt to continue the bearish trend wave sequence with another bearish
Consecutive Wave 4. However, Wave 4 fails to produce a lower low than
the low of Wave 3. Moreover, a reverse head-and-shoulders pattern occurs
within the bearish trend. The low of Wave 3 is the head, the low of Wave 2is the left shoulder, the low of Wave 4 is the right shoulder, and the trend
line connecting the highs of Correction 2 (C2) and Correction 3 (C3) form
the neckline resistance. The development of a reverse head-and-shoulders
pattern is not only an early indication of exhaustion and potential rever-
sal of the previously established downtrend, but also an early signal of aTrend Wave Failure. The Trend Wave Failure of the bearish Consecutive
Wave 4 leads to the development of a bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 in
the opposite direction of the bearish trend wave sequence.
Understanding Trend Wave Failure and its consequence, which, in
most instances, is the development of a Reversal-Trigger Wave, can be ahelpful tool that assists traders to recognize the end of the previous trendwave cycle and at the same time prepare in advance for the beginning of a
new trend cycle. The following chapter will reveal more details on the close
relationship between Trend Wave Failure and Reversal-Trigger Waves, aswell as the distinctive features of each trend wave in The Quarters Theory
Trend Waves cycle.
THE REVERSAL-TRIGGER WAVE
The Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is the most important trend wave because
each Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle always begins and ends with a
Reversal-Trigger Wave. The occurrence of a Reversal-Trigger Wave marks
not only the end of the previous trend wave cycle, but also the beginning ofa new one. This is why proper recognition of the Reversal-Trigger Waves
is absolutely necessary for the process of proper wave count. Failure to
correctly identify a Reversal-Trigger Wave in a trend wave cycle not onlyleads to inaccurate wave count but also causes a lack of clear perspective
of the different stages of trend progression.
Contrary to the popular belief that the ﬁrst trend waves in each cy-
cle might be difﬁcult to recognize and prepare for, The Quarters The-ory Trend Waves method makes proper identiﬁcation of Reversal-Trigger
Waves easier by deﬁning the factors that cause their establishment. Thereare two main factors that lead to the development of Reversal-Trigger
Waves: Trend Wave Failure and Corrections exceeding 100% retracement
of their preceding trend waves.
As discussed previously, Reversal-Trigger Waves in most instances oc-
cur as a consequence of a Trend Wave Failure. Let us apply our knowledge

of Trend Wave Failure and try to identify the Reversal-Trigger Waves in
the next example. Figure 4.5 shows the daily trend wave cycles of the
USD/JPY currency pair for a period of three months. Note that two impor-tant Reversal-Trigger Waves have occurred in that period. The ﬁrst bullish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1) develops as a result of a Trend Wave Fail-
ure of the Conclusive Wave 3, which fails to produce a lower low thanthe low of the bearish Progressive Wave 2. The bullish Reversal-Trigger
Wave 1 (RT1) conﬁrms itself as successful by breaking above the high (C2
High) of Correction 2, which follows after the bearish Progressive Wave 2.The bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1) ends the bearish trend wave se-
quence and marks the beginning of a new bullish trend wave cycle. The
bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is followed by a sequence of additionalbullish trend waves, leading to a complete reversal of the previously es-
tablished bearish trend. The bullish trend wave cycle is strong, but it also
becomes extended (consisting of ﬁve bullish trend waves). The bullish Con-
secutive Wave 5 makes an attempt to continue the bullish trend wave cy-
cle further; however, it fails to produce a higher high than the high of the
bullish Consecutive Wave 4. The Trend Wave Failure of Wave 5 leads to thedevelopment of a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1) in the opposite di-
rection of the previously established bullish trend wave cycle. The bearish

P1: SBT
c04 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:18 Printer: Yet to come
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves 123
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1) conﬁrms itself as successful by breaking
below the low of Correction 4 (C4), which follows after the bullish Consec-
utive Wave 4. The bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 ends the ﬁve-bullish-
trend-waves cycle and marks the beginning of a new bearish trend wavecycle that continues further when the bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is
followed by a bearish Progressive Wave 2. Both of the Reversal-Trigger
Waves in the three-month period of this example have occurred as a result
of a Trend Wave Failure.
The second main factor that causes the development of Reversal-
Trigger Waves is corrections exceeding 100% retracement of their preced-ing trend waves. These are instances when a Correction that follows a
trend wave exceeds the complete 100% Fibonacci retracement level of therange between the high and the low of its preceding trend wave. Correc-
tions that produce larger than 100% retracements break below the preced-
ing bullish wave’s low or above the preceding bearish wave’s high, andbecome Reversal-Trigger Waves.
Figure 4.6 shows a strong trend sequence consisting of four bullish
trend waves. The Correction 4 (C4) following the bullish ConsecutiveWave 4 reaches the complete 100% Fibonacci retracement of the range
between the high and the low of Wave 4, which is marked by the Low of

124 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Wave 4. When Correction 4 (C4) exceeds the complete 100% Fibonacci
retracement and breaks below the low of Wave 4, Correction 4 becomes
a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1). The development of the bearish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 conﬁrms the end of the strong bullish trend wavesequence, and leads to a more signiﬁcant price correction than the simple
Correction following the bullish Consecutive Wave 4. Please note in the
example that follows that the Correction 1 (C1) that follows the bearish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 also exceeds the complete 100% Fibonacci
retracement, marked by the high of the bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1(same as the high of Wave 4). As Correction 1 (C1) exceeds the complete
100% Fibonacci retracement and breaks above the high of the bearish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1 High), Correction 1 (C1) becomes a bullishReversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1). This is an example of a real-life market sit-
uation where a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 happens to be immediately
followed by another bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 in the opposite direc-tion. The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method considers such a develop-
ment to be an attempt to continue the previously established strong bullish
trend with the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, which follows immedi-ately after the more signiﬁcant price correction produced by the bearish
Reversal-Trigger Wave.
Although they may not occur very often, there are some complicated
instances when sequences of three or more bullish and bearish Reversal-Trigger Waves following each other may develop. The Quarters Theory
Trend Waves method considers such cases to be a sign of a nondirectional,
trendless market. These are consolidation periods of volatile but sideways
price action that normally occur after extended trend wave cycles have
ended. The sequences of two or more bullish and bearish Reversal-Trigger
Waves following each other often lead to breakouts that come as attempts
to either continue or reverse previously established trends.
Figure 4.7 shows three Reversal-Trigger Waves that follow each other.
The ﬁrst bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 occurs as a result of a Trend WaveFailure of the bearish Conclusive Wave 3. The ﬁrst bullish Reversal-TriggerWave 1 is then immediately followed by Consolidation 1 (C1), which ex-
ceeds the 100% retracement, breaks below the low of the ﬁrst bullish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, and becomes a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave1. The bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is then immediately followed by
a second bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 in the opposite direction. Note
that Consolidation 1 (C1) does not exceed the complete 100% Fibonacci re-tracement of the second bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1. Finally, the sec-
ond bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is followed by a bullish Progressive
Wave 2 that produces a decisive breakout above previous highs and con-ﬁrms the reversal of the bearish trend cycle consisting of the three bearish
trend waves shown in the beginning of the chart.

FIGURE 4.7 Reversal-Trigger Waves Following Each Other
Corrections that produce 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, or up to 61.8% Fibonacci
retracements are considered normal. As long as the retracements during
corrections do not exceed these Fibonacci retracement levels, traders cananticipate such corrections to be followed by another trend wave that will
attempt to continue the previously established trend. However, if a Cor-
rection exceeds the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, the larger retracementshould be used as an early warning sign that the Correction might reach
and possibly exceed the complete 100% Fibonacci retracement and become
a Reversal-Trigger Wave.
The Fibonacci retracements are helpful not only when monitoring cor-
rections for signs of future trend continuation or potential trend-reversalsignals that may lead to the development of Reversal-Trigger Waves.Fibonacci retracements of entire trend wave cycles can also be used to
indicate support or resistance levels that may be challenged during coun-
tertrend cycles of more signiﬁcant price corrections. The Quarters The-ory Trend Waves method does not require the development of a classic
Elliott Wave principle corrective cycle consisting of Waves A, B, and C.
Corrective countertrend cycles can have a single Reversal-Trigger Wave,or may consist of several trend waves that follow a countertrend Reversal-
Trigger Wave. The more trend waves in a corrective countertrend cycle, the

126 THE QUARTERS THEORY
bigger and more signiﬁcant the price correction. On the other hand, traders
should be careful if a corrective countertrend cycle exceeds the 61.8% Fi-
bonacci retracement level of a previous trend wave cycle, as this could
signal complete 100% retracement and potential trend reversal.
Figure 4.8 shows a strong uptrend consisting of ﬁve bullish trend
waves. The range of the bullish cycle is deﬁned by the low of Wave 1 andthe high of Wave 4 (since the bullish Consecutive Wave 5 fails to produce
a higher high than the high of Wave 4). The Trend Wave Failure of Con-
secutive Wave 5 leads to the development of a bearish Reversal-TriggerWave 1 that ends the bullish trend wave cycle and begins a corrective coun-
tertrend cycle. Traders who look for an opportunity to capitalize on the
countertrend move during the bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 may ﬁnd aconservative price target and a potential support level by calculating the
23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the total number of PIPs accomplished
during the entire ﬁve-bullish-trend-waves cycle. In the next example, thebearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 ﬁnds support at the 23.6% Fibonacci re-
tracement, ends, and goes through Correction 1 (C1), followed by another
bearish Progressive Wave 2 that challenges and ﬁnds support around the50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire ﬁve-bullish-waves cycle. The
bearish trend wave sequence does not continue further because the bearish

The Quarters Theory Trend Waves 127
Conclusive Wave 3 fails to produce a lower low than the low of the bear-
ish Progressive Wave 2. The Trend Wave Failure of the bearish Conclusive
Wave 3 is followed by a volatile trendless sequence of bullish and bearish
Reversal-Trigger Waves following each other, ending the corrective coun-tertrend cycle of three bearish waves. Since the signiﬁcant price correction
during the countertrend cycle of three bearish waves does not exceed the
normal 50% to 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, there is a good probability
that the previously established uptrend could continue once the corrective
trend wave cycle is ﬁnished. This exact scenario takes place in Figure 4.8,where the second Bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 followed by a success-
ful bullish Progressive Wave 2 produce a new bullish trend wave sequence
that continues the previously established uptrend.
The Reversal-Trigger Waves can create great countertrend- or trend-
continuation trading opportunities, as long as traders are able to recognizethe early signs that signal their development. Traders who have missedcatching a Reversal-Trigger Wave on time may choose to sit on the side-
lines, let the Reversal-Trigger Wave play out, monitor the Correction that
follows it, calculate the Fibonacci retracement levels that may be targetedduring the correction, make sure that the Correction does not exceed the
61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, and decide whether there is a good
probability for the Reversal-Trigger Wave to be followed by another Pro-gressive Wave 2 that could extend the trend further.
THE PROGRESSIVE WAVE
The Progressive Wave is the second phase in the ideal Quarters TheoryTrend Waves cycle. Since this trend wave is the equivalent to Wave 3 in theclassic Elliott Wave principle, the Progressive Wave is likely to have the
same distinctive features as the classic Elliott Wave 3. In an ideal pattern,
the Progressive Wave is expected to be the strongest and longest lasting,capable of producing the most signiﬁcant price moves compared to all
other trend waves in The Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle. Because of
these characteristics, some traders call the Progressive Wave “the meat ofthe trade.”
The Progressive Wave is considered the easiest trend wave to antici-
pate and trade. Once again, the Fibonacci retracement provides a helpfultool for traders looking to take advantage of the Progressive Wave. The
familiar 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8% Fibonacci retracements can offer re-
liable price points of reference that may serve as support or resistancelevels during corrections following Reversal-Trigger Waves. As long as a
Correction that follows a Reversal-Trigger Wave does not exceed the 61.8%

--- PAGE 146 ---

128 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Fibonacci retracement level, there is a good probability that another Pro-
gressive Wave 2 may follow the Reversal-Trigger Wave. On the other hand,
a Correction that exceeds the 100% Fibonacci retracement of a preceding
Reversal-Trigger Wave will become a Reversal-Trigger Wave in the oppo-site direction, rather than develop as a Progressive Wave 2.
Corrections that exceed the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of a
Reversal-Trigger Wave can serve as early warning signs of a possible com-
plete 100% retracement that might lead to a potential trend-reversal at-
tempt with the development of a Reversal-Trigger Wave.
Figure 4.9 shows an example of an ideal Progressive Wave 2 in a Quar-
ters Theory Trend Waves cycle. The bullish trend wave sequence beginswith a Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 (RT1). The Correction 1 (C1) following theReversal-Trigger Wave 1 does not exceed the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement;
it ﬁnds support around the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level and is fol-
lowed by a strong Progressive Wave 2. The Progressive Wave 2 extends thebullish trend further and produces a signiﬁcant price move.
To calculate approximately how far a Progressive Wave may extend
and to determine future support/resistance levels that could be targetedduring a Progressive Wave, traders may use the Fibonacci extension of the
Reversal-Trigger Wave that precedes a Progressive Wave. The 161.8% or
FIGURE 4.9 Ideal Progressive Wave 2

The Quarters Theory Trend Waves 129
200% Fibonacci extensions would basically mean that a Progressive Wave
may extend as far as 1.618 times or even double the size of the Reversal-
Trigger Wave. This is provided that the Progressive Wave not only is suc-
cessful and produces a higher high (or a lower low in downtrends) than thehigh (or the low) of the Reversal-Trigger Wave, but also is strong enough
to be able to target these Fibonacci extension levels.
Figure 4.10 shows a perfect Progressive Wave 2 that successfully
reaches both the 161.8% and the 200% Fibonacci extensions of the Reversal-
Trigger Wave 1 (RT1). Anticipating that each Progressive Wave would dou-ble in size compared to the preceding Reversal-Trigger Wave might be a
bit unrealistic; therefore, the 161.8% Fibonacci extension could serve as
a more conservative proﬁt target during Progressive Waves. In this ex-ample, a protective stop may be placed below the previous support level
found at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1
(RT1). When using Fibonacci extensions to determine future ProgressiveWave price targets, traders should make sure that there are no previously
established support/resistance levels in the way of the Fibonacci exten-
sions, because such support/resistance levels may prevent a ProgressiveWave from extending further and reaching the Fibonacci extensions of a
Reversal-Trigger Wave.

130 THE QUARTERS THEORY
The Progressive Waves are capable of producing signiﬁcant price
moves and may provide excellent trading opportunities; however, as with
the rest of the trend waves in The Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle, the
Progressive Waves are not exempt from the danger of Trend Wave Failure.The only way a Progressive Wave would be able to develop further is if
it were to conﬁrm itself as successful by breaking above the high (or be-
low the low) of its preceding Reversal-Trigger Wave. If a Progressive Wavedoes not provide such conﬁrmation, the signs might be there that the wave
could fail and another Reversal-Trigger Wave in the opposite direction ofthe Progressive Wave could develop as an attempt to reverse the previously
established trend.
THE CONCLUSIVE WAVE
As long as the Correction following a Progressive Wave does not exceedthe wave’s 100% Fibonacci retracement, a third Conclusive Wave may con-
tinue the trend wave sequence. Conclusive Wave 3 is the equivalent toWave 5 of the classic Elliott Waves and could become the wave that con-
cludes an ideal Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle. The name Conclusive
Wave reﬂects a trend wave that might produce limited price moves and
might be shorter than other trend waves.
Figure 4.11 shows a typical Conclusive Wave 3. Consolidation 2 (C2)
following Progressive Wave 2 does not exceed the 100% retracement; itﬁnds support around 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of Progressive Wave 2,
and a third Conclusive Wave 3 develops. Conclusive Wave 3 conﬁrms it-self as successful by breaking above the high of Progressive Wave 2 and
continues the bullish trend sequence. However, note how limited and how
much shorter Conclusive Wave 3 is compared to Reversal-Trigger Wave 1and Progressive Wave 2 in this example.
Conclusive Waves should always be approached with extra caution,
not only because they could be the ﬁnal stage of a trend wave sequence,but also because they tend to have increased probability to fail. The con-
sequence of a Conclusive Wave failure in most cases will be the develop-
ment of a Reversal-Trigger Wave in the opposite direction of the ConclusiveWave. A Reversal-Trigger Wave is also likely to develop if the Correction
following a Conclusive Wave exceeds the 100% Fibonacci retracement. In
both instances, the development of a Reversal-Trigger Wave would markthe end of the previously established trend wave sequence. At the same
time, the Reversal-Trigger Wave will indicate the beginning of what could
become a strong corrective countertrend cycle.
Figure 4.12 shows an example of a short-lived Conclusive Wave 3 that
does not produce a lower low than the low of the Progressive Wave 2. The

132 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Conclusive Wave 3 fails to continue the bearish trend wave sequence. The
Trend Wave Failure of the Conclusive Wave 3 is immediately followed by a
bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 that ends the bearish trend wave sequence
and makes an attempt to reverse the downtrend.
CONSECUTIVE WAVES
In the classic Elliott Wave pattern, the ideal ﬁve-wave impulse uptrend
sequence is followed by three corrective waves A, B, and C down (see
Figure 4.13). But what if the corrective Wave A does not produce a lower
low than the low of Wave 4, and instead Wave A is followed by Wave B,
which breaks above the high of Wave 5?
Let us assume that the previous scenario simply means that we might
see the development of a complex Elliot Wave pattern where Wave 5 con-sists of three smaller subwaves. In this case, the pattern would look like
Figure 4.14: Wave 5 becomes the longest in the pattern and has three
smaller subwaves.
But what if the trend continues even further beyond the three smaller
subwaves of the complex Wave 5? Consider the following real-life example,where a bearish trend wave sequence continues beyond Wave 5, consisting
of three smaller bearish subwaves in a complex Elliott Wave pattern. Whatis an Elliott Wave trader to do then?
Figure 4.15 illustrates some of the main problems for Elliott Wave
traders. When complex Elliott Wave patterns of waves within waves oc-
cur and the trend wave sequences extend beyond complex Elliott Wave

patterns, traders can easily get confused and end up losing track of the
proper wave count.
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method addresses this issue by
completely eliminating the need for recognition of complex Elliott Wavepatterns. The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method simply provides for
additional trend waves in order to properly quantify the progression of the
trend in each cycle. The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method acknowl-
edges that in real market conditions, each trend wave sequence does not
always end exactly after the ideal classic Elliott Wave pattern of ﬁve im-pulse waves, even when one of the waves in the pattern becomes complex,
consisting of three smaller subwaves. This is why there are no complex
waves and no corrective waves A, B, and C in The Quarters Theory TrendWaves cycle.
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method leaves the future possibil-
ities open and lets the market indicate whether there will be a continua-tion or a reversal of the previously established trend. Depending on market
conditions, The Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycles can be ideal (con-
sisting of a perfect three-trend wave pattern), short cycle (having less than
the ideal three trend waves), or extended (consisting of more than three
trend waves). Conclusive Wave 3 could become the ﬁnal phase of an ideal
Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle, but The Quarters Theory Trend Wavesmethod does not require a corrective pattern of two waves in the oppo-
site direction to follow each Conclusive Wave. Instead, The Quarters The-
ory Trend Waves method simply considers that each trend wave, including
Conclusive Wave 3, is followed by a Correction. As long as the Correc-
tion following the Conclusive Wave 3 does not exceed the 100% Fibonacciretracement by producing a lower low than the low of the Conclusive
Wave 3, the bullish trend sequence could continue with an attempt for an-
other trend wave number 4. If the new trend wave 4 produces a higherhigh than the high of the Consecutive Wave 3, the bullish trend progresses
further. The same is valid for bearish trends. As long as the Correction fol-
lowing a bearish Conclusive Wave 3 does not exceed the 100% Fibonacciretracement by producing a higher high than the high of the Conclusive
Wave 3, the bearish trend sequence could continue with an attempt for
another bearish trend wave number 4. If the new bearish trend wave 4 pro-duces a lower low than the low of the Consecutive Wave 3, the bearish
trend progresses further.
Each new trend wave that follows the Consecutive Wave 3 in an ideal
sequence of three Quarters Theory Trend Waves is given the name Consec-
utive Wave 4. Figure 4.16 shows a real-life example of an Extended Quar-
ters Theory Trend Wave sequence consisting of four bullish trend waves.Note that Correction 3 (C3) does not exceed the 100% Fibonacci retrace-
ment and does not produce a lower low than the low of Conclusive Wave 3;

FIGURE 4.16 Consecutive Wave 4 in an Extended Quarters Theory Trend Waves
Sequence
another bullish Consecutive Wave 4 conﬁrms itself as successful by break-
ing above the high of Conclusive Wave 3 and continues the bullish trendwave sequence.
As shown previously, in some instances an extended trend wave se-
quence may consist of more than four trend waves. If a Correction fol-lowing a Consecutive Wave 4 does not exceed the 100% Fibonacci retrace-
ment and remains at or above the low (or the high in bearish trend wave
sequences) of the Consecutive Wave 4, there may even be an attempt tocontinue the trend with another Consecutive Wave 5. Consecutive Wave 5
might even be followed by more Consecutive Waves 6, 7, and so forth.
Even though this scenario does not occur very often, we should not ignorethe possibility that more than three, four, or even ﬁve trend waves could
develop, especially in instances when the main trend is very strong. Fig-
ure 4.17 shows an example of an Extended Quarters Theory Trend Wavecycle consisting of seven bearish trend waves.
The development of one or more Consecutive Waves is an indication
of a strong trend. Although strong trends have the tendency to continuebeyond the ideal three trend waves of The Quarters Theory Trend Waves
cycle, it is important to remember that the Consecutive Waves are not only

indicative of a strong trend, but they are also a warning sign that the exist-
ing trend has become extended and that a more signiﬁcant price correction
may occur soon. As usual, such signiﬁcant price correction would come inthe form of a Reversal-Trigger Wave that would end the extended trend
wave sequence and could produce a corrective countertrend move in the
opposite direction of the previously established trend wave cycle. Tradersshould be very careful when trading during Consecutive Wave periods. Be-
cause of their extended nature, Consecutive Waves have the highest likeli-
hood to fail compared with any other trend waves in The Quarters TheoryTrend Waves cycle.
EXTENDED TREND WAVES
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycles become extended when they con-
sist of more than three trend waves. Not only the trend wave cycles, but
also any of the individual trend waves in a trend wave cycle may becomeextended. The Extended Waves in The Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle
are not to be confused with the waves within waves in a complex Elliott

Wave pattern. The Extended Quarters Theory trend waves do not consist
of smaller subwaves. The Extended Waves in The Quarters Theory Trend
Waves cycle are elongated trend waves that last for prolonged periods oftime (at least ﬁve or more consecutive time periods of ﬁve months, weeks,days, minutes, etc., depending on the time intervals chosen to be analyzed).
The Extended Waves are an indication of a strong trend. They can ad-
vance the trend further, produce signiﬁcant price moves, and create great
trading opportunities. Figure 4.18 shows a strong trend wave cycle consist-
ing of four bullish trend waves. Note that the Extended Progressive Wave 2that normally is expected to be the longest-lasting trend wave in the se-
quence is followed by another Extended Conclusive Wave 3 that is just as
long as Progressive Wave 2. Progressive Wave 2 and Conclusive Wave 3both last for a period of six days and become Extended Waves. The de-
velopment of an Extended Conclusive Wave 3 indicates a strong trend. In
this example, the entire trend wave cycle becomes extended when anotherbullish Consecutive Wave 4 progresses the trend further.
Although the Extended Waves are indicative of strong trends, The
Quarters Theory Trend Waves method recognizes that the Extended Wavescan also have some adverse effects on the trend waves that follow them.
One of the ways that the Extended Waves can affect other waves is by

shortening the length of the trend wave that follows an Extended Wave.
For example, in the ideal Quarters Theory Trend Waves cycle, Progressive
Wave 2 is extended and the Conclusive Wave 3 that follows it is shorter in
size compared to Extended Progressive Wave 2. Please note in Figure 4.19that the Extended Conclusive Wave 3 is followed by a shortened Consecu-
tive Wave 4.
An even more dangerous effect of the Extended Waves is that they
tend to increase the potential for a Trend Wave Failure of the trend waves
that follow Extended Waves. The Extended Waves are not only indicativeof a strong trend, they should also be considered a sign of extended, over-
bought, or oversold trend conditions that may be long overdue for a signiﬁ-
cant price correction. This is why trend waves that follow Extended Wavesmight not only be shortened but might also experience a Trend Wave Fail-
ure followed by a corrective countertrend move in the opposite direction
of the previously established trend.
Figure 4.20 shows an example of a Trend Wave Failure caused by
an Extended Wave. Note that the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 com-pletely reverses the previously established bearish trend and produces asigniﬁcant price move. However, the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 lasts ten
days and becomes overextended, increasing the probabilities for a Trend

COMBINING THE QUARTERS
THEORY AND THE QUARTERSTHEORY TREND WAVES
The Quarters Theory, which is based on the premise that the daily ﬂuc-
tuations of currency exchange rates are not random and that currency
exchange rates ﬂuctuate in an orderly fashion from one Large Quarter
Point to the next, provides constant and reliable, never-changing ranges of250 PIPs. The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method, based on the Elliott
Wave principle, offers predictable cyclical repetitions of market patterns

140 THE QUARTERS THEORY
consisting of a series of trend waves. The percentages of Fibonacci re-
tracements provide clearly deﬁned measurements to determine support or
resistance in periods of price correction. When used together, The Quar-
ters Theory, The Quarters Theory Trend Waves, and the Fibonacci retrace-ments deliver better perspective and predictability; well-known, constant
price ranges of 250 PIPs; reliable measures of price correction percentages
that are respected by market participants, and predictable cycles of trend
waves to identify the different stages of trend progression. Combining them
reduces the element of the unknown and increases the probability of suc-cess when forecasting the direction of future price moves.
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method considers it an ideal com-
bination when a new trend wave coincides with a new Large Quarter. Insuch instances, a currency pair starts to work on a new Large Quarter of
250 PIPs at the same time that a new trend wave begins. This is a perfect
scenario, recognized by The Quarters Theory as the stage of the trend pro-gression and trend wave development that increases the probabilities for
successful completion of Large Quarters.
The following example shows the GBP/USD pair in a bullish trend
wave cycle. The Correction 1 (C1) following the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1(RT1) produces a signiﬁcant price pullback but ﬁnds support above the
Large Quarter Point at 1.4250. Note that Progressive Wave 2 perfectly co-incides with the GBP/USD pair, beginning to work on the Large Quarter
above 1.4250 toward the Large Quarter Point at 1.4500. The strong Pro-
gressive Wave 2 not only completes the Large Quarter between 1.4250 and
1.4500, but also manages to successfully complete a second Large Quarter
of 250 PIPs between the Large Quarter Points at 1.4500 and 1.4750. Aftercompleting the Large Quarter toward 1.4750, Progressive Wave 2 makes an
attempt to work on yet another third Large Quarter above 1.4750 toward
1.5000. However, Progressive Wave 2 exhausts and the Large Quarter from1.4750 to 1.5000 is not successfully completed. Progressive Wave 2 ends
and is followed by Correction 2 (C2).
Trend waves that do not produce a successful completion of a Large
Quarter may come to an end and go through a period of Correction. Af-ter the Correction, if another trend wave develops in the same direction
as the previous one, the new trend wave would be likely to make an at-tempt to work on the same Large Quarter that the previous trend wave has
not completed. If they are successful in progressing the main trend further,
such new, follow-up trend waves may have a better chance of completingthe same Large Quarter that was not successfully completed during the
preceding trend wave. In the same example, after Correction 2, the bullish
trend wave sequence continues further with Conclusive Wave 3, which suc-cessfully completes the Large Quarter 1.4750 to 1.5000 that the preceding
Progressive Wave 2 was not capable of completing.

The Quarters Theory Trend Waves 141
FIGURE 4.21 Trend Waves Coinciding with Large Quarters
Note that in Figure 4.21 Progressive Wave 2 produces a successful
completion of two Large Quarters of 250 PIPs each. Theoretically, since
the Progressive Waves usually have the tendency to become extended, they
are the trend waves that would be most likely to complete multiple LargeQuarters. On the other hand, The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method
acknowledges that any one of the trend waves in the cycle could become
extended and may be capable of producing signiﬁcant price moves lead-ing to the successful completion of multiple Large Quarters. In Figure 4.22,
the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 becomes extended and manages to complete
successfully three consecutive Large Quarters of 250 PIPs each: 1.2750 to1.3000, 1.3000 to 1.3250, and 1.3250 to 1.3500.
The development of Extended Waves that produce a successful com-
pletion of multiple Large Quarters is an indication of a strong trend, butit should also be considered a warning sign that a large price move may
have occurred “too fast, too soon” and that a more signiﬁcant countertrend
price correction might follow at any time. Realistically, it should not beanticipated that every trend wave will be capable of completing multiple
Large Quarters. The main premise of The Quarters Theory offers a more
conservative approach, allowing traders to monitor each trend wave’s pro-gression one Large Quarter at a time. Since The Quarters Theory considers
every signiﬁcant price move to be a move from one Large Quarter Point

to the next, once a trend wave produces a successful completion of one
Large Quarter of 250 PIPs, even if the trend wave continues further, tradersshould be on the lookout for signs of exhaustion and unsuccessful comple-
tion of each following Large Quarter. The unsuccessful completion of a
Large Quarter can often cause the end of a trend wave.
Note in Figure 4.23 that the bullish Progressive Wave 2 successfully
completes one Large Quarter from 65.00 to 67.50. Progressive Wave 2 thencontinues further and makes an attempt to work on another Large Quarterabove 67.50 toward 70.00, but fails to complete the quarter successfully.
The unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter 67.50 to 70.00 leads to
the end of Progressive Wave 2 followed by a price correction. After Correc-tion 2 (C2), the bullish trend wave sequence continues further with Con-
clusive Wave 3, which also makes an attempt to work on the same Large
Quarter 67.50 to 70.00 that Progressive Wave 2 has failed to complete. Con-clusive Wave 3 attempts to work on the same Large Quarter that was not
successfully completed by Progressive Wave 2; however, Conclusive Wave
3 is also not capable of producing a successful completion of the LargeQuarter 67.50 to 70.00. Both trend waves end as a result of the unsuccess-
ful completion of the Large Quarter 67.50 to 70.00.

The Quarters Theory Trend Waves 143
FIGURE 4.23 Unsuccessful Completion of a Large Quarter, Causing the End of
Trend Waves
The inability of two trend waves in a row to complete the same Large
Quarter of 250 PIPs is a sign of exhaustion of the existing trend and is
often a contributing factor to the ending of an entire trend wave cycle.
Note in the previous example that the unsuccessful completion of the Large
Quarter 67.50 to 70.00 by Progressive Wave 2 and the following ConclusiveWave 3 leads to the development of a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 that
ends the bullish trend wave cycle and makes a strong corrective counter-
trend move.
Corrections that follow trend waves can also coincide with Large Quar-
ters. Because the corrections produce countertrend moves, the Large Quar-ters likely to be worked on during a Correction normally are in the oppositedirection of the Large Quarters that were worked on during the trend wave
that preceded the Correction. In Figure 4.24, a bullish Reversal-Trigger
Wave 1 completes the Large Quarter from 132.50 to 135.00. Correction 1(C1), following the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, works on the opposite
Large Quarter and produces a successful completion of the Large Quarter
135.00 to 132.50.
Each Correction is closely related to its preceding trend wave. Ex-
tended, strong trend waves that have produced signiﬁcant price moves are

FIGURE 4.24 Correction Coinciding with a Large Quarter
likely to have larger corrections that would be more likely to complete a
Large Quarter. On the other hand, corrections that follow shorter trend
waves might not be capable of completing a Large Quarter. In general, cor-rections following trend waves result in price moves that go against the
main trend, so there is always a risk that a Correction may not be able to
complete a Large Quarter. Because of their countertrend nature and be-cause they may be short-lived when the main trend is strong, corrections
following trend waves might be less likely to produce successful comple-
tions of Large Quarters than the actual trend waves.
The price moves and the number of Large Quarters that realistically
can be expected to be successfully completed during a Correction can bedetermined by calculating the Fibonacci retracement percentages of therange, or the total amount of PIPs produced during the trend wave that pre-
cedes the Correction. The familiar 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% Fibonacci
retracement levels provide predictable future support or resistance levelsthat may be targeted during periods of corrections following trend waves.
In Figure 4.25, by calculating the Fibonacci retracement percentages of the
bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, we can determine whether we should re-alistically anticipate that Correction 1 (C1) would be able to successfully
complete the Large Quarter 135.00 to 132.50. In order for that Large Quarter

FIGURE 4.25 Correction Completing a Large Quarter
to be successfully completed, we will have to see the Correction being ca-
pable of reaching at least the vicinity of one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs from
the Large Quarter Point at 132.50. Considering that the range of Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is approximately 500 PIPs (from about 130.50 to 135.50), the
only way that Correction 1 (C1) will be able to complete the Large Quar-
ter 135.00 to 132.50 is if Correction 1 (C1) reaches the 61.8% Fibonacciretracement level, which would be about 300 PIPs below 135.50—the high
of Reversal-Trigger Wave 1.
Since corrections can be shortened when the main trend is strong, a
more conservative approach would be to not anticipate larger correctionsup to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level or complete 100% retrace-
ments. Corrections of 23.6% to 38.2% Fibonacci retracement may be a bitmore realistic and easier to accomplish consistently.
In Figure 4.26, the extended bullish Progressive Wave 2 produces
a very signiﬁcant price move of approximately 1400 PIPs—from a lowaround 1.3000 to the high around 1.4400. Correction 2 (C2) of 23.6% to 38.2%
Fibonacci retracement of the large price range of 1400 PIPs accomplished
during Progressive Wave 2 should see prices decline from the high around1.4400 by about 330 PIPs for the 23.6% retracement or by 534 PIPs if Correc-
tion 2 (C2) reaches the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. In this case, it

would not be unrealistic to anticipate that Correction 2 (C2) should see the
EUR/USD pair pulling back from the high around 1.4400 toward the preced-
ing Large Quarter Point at 1.4250 and that a price correction between 23.6%
and 38.2% Fibonacci retracement could deliver a downward move of ap-proximately 400 PIPs from the high around 1.4400, which should be enough
to produce a successful completion of the Large Quarter below 1.4250 to-
ward the Major Large Quarter Point at 1.4000 during Correction 2 (C2).

CHAPTER 5
The Quarters
Theory Trades
STRUCTURE AND TYPES
The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory Trend Waves method have a
common premise— order . The Quarters Theory arranges what some might
consider random price moves into an organized system by proposing that
currency exchange rates ﬂuctuate in an orderly fashion from one Large
Quarter Point to another within the constant 1000 and 250 PIP Ranges. TheQuarters Theory Trend Waves method is based on the Elliott Wave princi-
ple of predictable cyclical repetitions of market price patterns consisting
of series of waves that represent stages of trend progression. The notion of
chaos is foreign to the methodology of The Quarters Theory and The Quar-
ters Theory Trend Waves, and that concept is reﬂected in The QuartersTheory Trades.
Each one of The Quarters Theory Trades take place within the famil-
iar, constant Large Quarter ranges of 250 PIPs. Every trade idea is carefullyanalyzed and no aspect of The Quarters Theory Trade is left to chance.
Each Quarters Theory Trade is built on the solid foundation of a clear
fundamental and technical edge, or advantage of one currency over an-other, combined with the methodology of The Quarters Theory and The
Quarters Theory Trend Waves. The risk in each Quarters Theory Trade is
meticulously calculated: Every Quarters Theory Trade has a clear objectiveand type, as well as a predetermined entry point andproﬁt target , and a
stop that limits losses. The Quarters Theory Trades adhere to the structure
shown in Figure 5.1.

148 THE QUARTERS THEORY
FIGURE 5.1 Structure of The Quarters Theory Trades
The Quarters Theory Trades originate from trade ideas that are thor-
oughly explored by applying fundamental and technical analysis, combined
with the methodology of The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory
Trend Waves, in order to identify the trade’s edge and a clear advantage
of one currency against another in a currency pair. The trade edge cou-
pled with a perfect alignment between favorable fundamental and techni-
cal factors serve as the foundation of The Quarters Theory Trades, opening
the door to the next step in the process of preparing The Quarters TheoryTrade—determining the trade objective and using the methodology of The
Quarters Theory.
The trade objectives of The Quarters Theory Trades can be classiﬁed
in two categories: Large Quarter Completion trades that take advantage
of the signiﬁcant price moves in currency exchange rates from one Large
Quarter Point to another, and intra–Large Quarter trades that capitalize onthe smaller price moves between the important price points within a Large
Quarter. Each trade objective category includes different types of trades.
Thetrade type is chosen depending on the trade objective, as shown in
Figure 5.2.
Certain trade types have a supplemental reversal trade that is based on
potential reversals that may occur in cases when prices encounter strong

support or resistance at any one of the important price points within a
Large Quarter. Once a trade type is chosen, the next step would be to pro-
ceed with the actual trade setup, which involves calculating risk, deter-
mining exact entry price, proﬁt target/exit price, and a stop price to limit
potential losses. The ﬁnal trade execution step administers the placement
of the trade orders at the predetermined entry, exit, and stop-limit prices.
This chapter will reveal the different types of Quarters Theory Trades,
with their individual characteristics and similarities. Many practical exam-
ples will offer an inside look at the systematic structure of each one of The
Quarters Theory Trades.
THE LARGE QUARTER TRADE
The main trade of The Quarters Theory method is the Large Quarter Trade.
The objective of the Large Quarter Trade is the successful completion of
a Large Quarter. The Large Quarter Trade is based on the premise of TheQuarters Theory that currency exchange rates ﬂuctuate in an orderly man-
ner between the Large Quarter Points within each 1000 PIP Range, and
that every signiﬁcant price move in currency exchange rates takes placefrom one Large Quarter Point in an attempt to target another Large Quar-
ter Point.
The Large Quarter Trades are designed to take advantage of the suc-
cessful completion of a Large Quarter. The Quarters Theory considers aLarge Quarter to be successfully completed as long as there is a number
registered as a high, low, open, or close price within one Small Quarter of25 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point. The same rule applies for re-
versals that take prices back toward a preceding Large Quarter Point—as
long as a high, low, open, or close price number is registered within one

--- PAGE 168 ---

P1: SBT
c05 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:19 Printer: Yet to come
150 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Small Quarter of 25 PIPs from a Large Quarter Point, a reversal toward a
preceding Large Quarter Point or an inverse Large Quarter price move is
considered completed. These Large Quarter completion rules of The Quar-
ters Theory are taken into consideration in order to establish a realisticproﬁt target for each Large Quarter Trade. Since The Quarters Theory does
not require prices to reach each Large Quarter Point exactly up to the PIP
to consider a Large Quarter completed, both of the ranges of the Small
Quarters that precede each Large Quarter Point (25 PIP ×2=50 PIPs) can
be deducted from the total range of each Large Quarter: 250 – 50 =200.
This is how a more conservative, but also easier to achieve, proﬁt target of200 PIPs is determined for each Large Quarter Trade.
Entry or exit orders placed at the exact number representing a Large
Quarter Point may be difﬁcult to get ﬁlled consistently because prices mayfall short of reaching the exact Large Quarter Points; even if prices do reach
them, such orders still may not get executed because of the spreads be-tween bid and ask prices. This is the reason why the entry and exit price
points of Large Quarter Trades should not be placed at the exact Large
Quarter Points, but rather at the closest Small Quarter Point 25 PIPs to aLarge Quarter Point, or within the 25 PIP Range of each Small Quarter next
to a Large Quarter Point. To secure the best possible entry price and to
take full advantage of the projected proﬁt target of at least 200 PIPs, theentry orders of the Large Quarter Trades should not be placed farther than
25 PIPs from the Large Quarter Point that serves as the starting point of
the Large Quarter price move. Considering these requirements, the Large
Quarter Trades should comply with the structure shown in Figure 5.3.

The Quarters Theory Trades 151
Each Large Quarter Trade has a predetermined risk and an exact stop
price in order to limit losses. The stops of the Large Quarter Trades are es-
tablished by comparing the size of the realistic proﬁt target, or the reward
of the trade, in relation to the amount at risk of being lost should the tradereverse in the opposite direction. The Large Quarter Trades follow the sim-
ple risk/reward ratio of 2:1. Since the reward of each Large Quarter Trade
is a gain of at least 200 PIPs, the measured risk of each Large Quarter Trade
would normally be a loss of 100 PIPs. If the entry price is no further than
25 PIPs from the starting Large Quarter Point and the exit/proﬁt target isplaced 25 PIPs before the targeted Large Quarter Point, the proﬁt target
would be at least 200 PIPs, and at 2:1 risk/reward ratio, the stop should
be placed at least 100 PIPs from the entry price. However, in instanceswhen the entry price is exactly at the Small Quarter Point 25 PIPs from a
Large Quarter Point, if the stop were to be placed 100 PIPs below the en-
try price, the stop-limit price would fall exactly at the number representingthe End of the Hesitation Zone, 75 PIPs from the Large Quarter Point. In
such cases, the stops should be expanded by 10 PIPs for a total of 110 PIPs
in order to avoid the stop-limit price from being positioned exactly at theEnd of the Hesitation Zone. These stop expansions are necessary to make
sure that the stops of the Large Quarter Trades are always placed outside
of the Hesitation Zone to prevent the stop-limit orders from getting trig-gered while prices ﬂuctuate within it. The stops of the Large Quarter Trades
should be determined by using the 2:1 risk/reward ratio as a guideline, but
each stop should be carefully examined to make sure that the exact stop-
limit price does not coincide with any of the important price points within
the Large Quarters, or with any major support/resistance levels positionedwithin a Large Quarter. In general, the entry, exit/proﬁt target, and stop
prices of all Quarters Theory Trades should not coincide with any of the im-
portant price points within the Large Quarters or with any major support/resistance levels positioned within a Large Quarter.
Consider the following example of a Large Quarter Trade (see Fig-
ure 5.4). The EUR/USD pair currency exchange rate enters the Large Quar-ter 1.3750 to 1.4000 on May 20, 2009. Let us assume that the entry price
in this trade is at 1.3775—exactly 25 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point
1.3750. In this case, the realistic proﬁt target will be 200 PIPs and the exitprice should be set at 1.3975—exactly 25 PIPs below the Large Quarter
Point 1.4000. Since the expected proﬁt is 200 PIPs, by using the 2:1 risk/
reward ratio, the stop should be 100 PIPs below the entry point. However,considering that the stop of this Large Quarter Trade should not be placed
within the Hesitation Zone, 75 PIPs below the Large Quarter Point 1.3750,
and that the stop should not coincide with the End of the Hesitation Zone1.3675, the stop may be expanded by up to 10 PIPs for a total of 110 PIPs.
This means that the stop-limit order should be set at 1.3665, outside of the

Hesitation Zone, 10 PIPs below the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.3675. Plac-
ing the stop outside of the Hesitation Zone assures that the stop will not be
triggered and the position will be sustained, even if prices drop below theLarge Quarter Point 1.3750 and remain within the 75 PIP Range of the Hes-
itation Zone 1.3750 to 1.3675. Although on May 21, 2009, prices dip into the
Hesitation Zone below the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, the stop at 1.3665does not get triggered and the trade remains open. As the bullish trend
progresses further, prices complete the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000; the
Large Quarter Trade achieves its objective and produces a proﬁt of 200PIPs as the exit point/proﬁt target at 1.3975 is reached on May 22, 2009.
Besides a predetermined stop price, each Large Quarter Trade also
has a designated Time Stop based on the Three-Day Rule of The Quar-ters Theory. Large Quarter Trades must accomplish their objective in the
time period required by the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory of
three 24-hour trading sessions on the global foreign exchange market. Ifprices fail to complete a Large Quarter and a Large Quarter Trade has not
achieved its goal in the allowed three trading days, either the trade may
be closed by the end of the third day or the take-proﬁt limit price may bechanged to lock in any smaller proﬁts. Also on the third day, the stop price
should be moved to a breakeven level at the initial entry price to protect

the trade against losses. If it is too late to take the aforementioned steps,
the trade may simply be closed at a smaller loss to prevent prices from
reaching the predetermined 100 to 110 PIP stop-limit order that may get
triggered during trend reversals as a result of the unsuccessful completionof a Large Quarter.
Figure 5.5 shows the EUR/USD pair currency exchange rate transition-
ing into the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 on May 8, 2009. Let us assume
that the entry price in this Large Quarter Trade would be at 1.3525—exactly
25 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 1.3500. The exit price then should beset at 1.3725—exactly 25 PIPs below the Large Quarter Point 1.3750. Since
the expected proﬁt is 200 PIPs, at 2:1 risk/reward ratio, the stop should
be 100 PIPs below the entry point. However, considering that the stop ofthis Large Quarter Trade should not be placed within the Hesitation Zone
75 PIPs below the Large Quarter Point 1.3500, and that the stop should
not coincide with the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.3425, the stop may beexpanded by up to 10 PIPs for a total of 110 PIPs. This means that the
stop-limit order should be set at 1.3415—outside of the Hesitation Zone,
10 PIPs below the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.3425. On May 8, 2009, theﬁrst day since the Large Quarter Transition, prices make a decisive move
into the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. On May 12, 2009, the third day
since the Large Quarter Transition, prices reach the Whole Number 1.3700

preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750 but encounter resistance and fail
to complete the Large Quarter in the required three 24-hour trading ses-
sions. The inability to produce a decisive breakout above resistance at the
Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, the lastproblematic price point that may prevent the successful completion of the
Large Quarter, coupled with the three-day time stop of this Large Quar-
ter Trade, based on the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory, serve as
warning signs of potential reversal and signal the need for an exit strat-
egy. Closing the trade should be considered no later than by the end ofthe trading session on May 12, 2009, the third day since the Large Quarter
Transition. This Large Quarter Trade may be closed on the third day at a
smaller proﬁt anywhere between the Whole Numbers 1.3600 and 1.3700,or the take-proﬁt limit price may be lowered to around 1.3600 to lock in a
proﬁt. Also on the third day, May 12, 2009, the stop price should be moved
to a breakeven level at the initial entry price 1.3525. These measures wouldbe necessary to protect the trade against any losses that may have been re-
alized during the reversal back to the preceding Large Quarter Point 1.3500
as a result of the unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter.
Certain small variations are allowed as far as moving the stops of the
Large Quarter Trades, depending on the advancement of prices into theLarge Quarter. For example, if there is a decisive Large Quarter Transi-tion on the ﬁrst or second day and prices have already advanced deep into
the Large Quarter to the Whole Number preceding the Large Quarter Point
targeted, the stop can be moved to a breakeven level at the initial entry
price of the trade to protect against any losses, without having to wait until
the third day to do so. Another variation allows reducing the size of thestop in half from 100 or 110 PIPs to 50 or 55 PIPs in cases where there
is a decisive Large Quarter Transition on the ﬁrst or second day that has
seen prices advancing beyond the Half Point of a Large Quarter. However,when it comes to the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory, any varia-
tions are prohibited. The Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory should
not be bent by allowing more than three days for a Large Quarter comple-tion, and the three-day time stops of the Large Quarter Trades should be en-
forced very strictly to prevent or minimize losses and to assure consistent
trading results.

together in the process of identifying and taking advantage of Large Quar-
ter Trade opportunities. It is absolutely imperative that the Large Quarter
Trades have a clear fundamental and technical edge to increase their prob-
ability of success. Each Large Quarter Trade should be built on solid under-lying fundamentals and favorable technical developments. There should
be no contradictions between fundamentals and technicals. Considering
that a Large Quarter Trade is expected to last for up to three trading days,
consensus forecasts for any upcoming economic and geopolitical events
scheduled to take place during the trade’s three-day period should be ex-amined to make sure that they are in line with the current fundamental
backdrop and trend direction, and that the outcome of recent economic
reports or geopolitical events has not caused any shifts in the fundamentaledge of the trade or any reversals of the existing trend.
Large Quarter Trades should be meticulously timed so that they take
advantage of the most favorable stages of trend development when a trendwave coincides with a Large Quarter. These are the instances when a cur-
rency pair would work on a Large Quarter at the same time that a trend
wave develops. Strong bullish or bearish trend wave cycles can producesuccessful completions of multiple Large Quarters, providing the ideal en-
vironment for Large Quarter Trades. The daily and the one-hour charts are
the instruments of choice when identifying trend waves and Large QuarterTrade opportunities using the methodology of The Quarters Theory and
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves. Each Large Quarter Trade should be
aligned with the proper trend wave. The strength of a trend wave should
be used as the driving force that could deliver the completion of a Large
Quarter and could accomplish the objective of a Large Quarter Trade.
Figure 5.6 demonstrates how to recognize the trend waves that coin-
cide with Large Quarters and how to spot and take advantage of LargeQuarter Trade opportunities. The individual trend waves or the stages oftrend progression are identiﬁed using the methodology of The Quarters
Theory Trend Waves combined with technical analysis of price patterns,
breakouts, technical indicators, and so forth, which may be utilized forconﬁrmation and early warning purposes. In Figure 5.6, a careful anal-
ysis of the daily chart of the EUR/USD currency pair can reveal that a
bullish breakout above the high of a previous trend wave’s Consolidationleads to the development of a bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 that begins
a new bullish trend wave cycle consisting of two trend waves—the bullish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 and Progressive Wave 2. Correction 1, followingthe Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, sees prices pull back to a familiar level—the
38.2% Fibonacci retracement. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement serves as
support, ending Correction 1 and leading to the development of Progres-sive Wave 2. By the end of the Progressive Wave, the head-and-shoulders
reversal pattern signals potential trend reversal. A bearish breakout below

tunities
the neck of the head-and-shoulders pattern leads to the development of a
bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, which ends the bullish trend wave cycle.
Adding technical indicators can provide early warning and conﬁrma-
tion signals in the process of identifying Large Quarter Trade opportunities.As shown in Figure 5.7, the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 begins at the
time when price ﬁnds support at its 10-day moving average. The RelativeStrength Index (RSI) shows normal conditions with price just above 50 at
the time when the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 starts to develop. Please
note that during the pullback of Correction 1, prices remain above the10-day moving average—a development that signals that Correction 1 may
be coming to an end as it approaches potential support at the 10-day mov-
ing average mark, and that if prices do not break below the 10-day movingaverage support, a second bullish Progressive Wave 2 may establish as an
attempt to continue the bullish trend wave cycle. Note also that Reversal-
Trigger Wave 1 and Progressive Wave 2 end shortly after the RSI breachesabove 70—the level signaling overbought conditions, which can be used as
an early warning sign that the trend waves may be coming to an end.
Now, let us see whether the trend waves described earlier coincide
with certain Large Quarters. The daily chart of the EUR/USD currencypair shown in Figure 5.8 reveals that Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 perfectly

coincides with the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 and the Large Quarter
1.3750 to 1.4000. After both Large Quarters are successfully completed dur-
ing the strong Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, Correction 1 (C1) that follows the
trend wave sees prices pull back below the Large Quarter Point 1.4000.When Correction 1 ends, the bullish trend wave cycle continues with an-
other Progressive Wave 2, which moves prices back up to the Large Quar-
ter Point 1.4000. As prices continue above the Large Quarter Point 1.4000,
Progressive Wave 2 coincides with and completes the Large Quarter 1.4000
to 1.4250. Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 and Progressive Wave 2 of this exam-ple’s bullish trend wave cycle provide opportunities for three Large Quarter
Trades that can be set up according to the Large Quarter Trade entry, exit,
and stop guidelines, in order to take advantage of the strength of the trendwaves, leading to the completion of the Large Quarters 1.3500 to 1.3750,
1.3750 to 1.4000, and 1.4000 to 1.4250.
The individual trend waves identiﬁed on a daily chart can be dissected
using a one-hour chart. The one-hour charts can provide an even closerhour-by-hour look at the price behavior before, during, and after each trend
wave. Certain price patterns, pullbacks, and breakouts can also be spottedon the one-hour charts as their most important role is to assist when mon-
itoring price behavior for the duration of each Large Quarter Trade and to
provide potential early warning signs that may signal reversals and unsuc-cessful completion of the Large Quarters that coincide with the individual
trend waves.
Figure 5.9 shows Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, identiﬁed earlier using the
daily chart of the EUR/USD currency pair dissected into smaller time pe-
riods using a one-hour chart. Note that on the left-hand side of the chart,the Falling Wedge pattern signals a bullish breakout that takes prices back
to the Large Quarter Point 1.3500. The breakout serves as the beginning
phase in the development of the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, whichcauses prices to transition above the Large Quarter Point 1.3500 on May
18, 2009, the ﬁrst day when the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 begins to
work on and coincides with the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. Recogniz-ing that the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 presents an opportunity for comple-
tion of the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750, a Large Quarter Trade can be
set up with an entry price at 1.3525. Based on the entry price, a realisticproﬁt target/exit price would be 1.3725—25 PIPs ahead of the Large Quar-
ter Point 1.3750. Comparing the entry price and the 200 PIP proﬁt target
using the 2:1 risk/reward ratio, the stop-limit price of that trade should be100 PIPs, but to prevent it from being positioned within the Hesitation Zone
75 PIPs below the Large Quarter Point 1.3500, the stop can be extended by
10 PIPs for a total of 110 PIPs. In that case, the stop price would be 1.3415.With the exact entry, exit, and stop prices established, the Reversal-Trigger
Wave 1 takes off, completing the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 in exactly

three days: May 18, 19, and 20, in line with the Three-Day Rule of The Quar-
ters Theory. As a result, the Large Quarter Trade accomplishes its objective
and reaches its proﬁt target at 1.3725 by taking full advantage of Reversal-
Trigger Wave 1 and the successful completion of the Large Quarter 1.3500to 1.3750.
As shown in Figure 5.9, the strong bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1
continues even further, and after completing the Large Quarter 1.3500 to
1.3750, prices begin to work on another one—the Large Quarter 1.3750 to
1.4000. Prices enter the new Large Quarter above the Large Quarter Point1.3750 on May 20, 2009, but never exit the Hesitation Zone 75 PIPs above
the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, pull back toward it, and even dip brieﬂy
into the previous Large Quarter below the Large Quarter Point 1.3750.During this pullback and consolidation period, prices form a Flag trend-
continuation pattern that serves as an early signal that the bullish trend
wave might continue further and that the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 mightwork more decisively on the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000. Based on these
developments, a Large Quarter Trade can be established to take advan-
tage of the opportunity if the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 were to continuefurther and complete the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000. As prices reen-
ter the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000 on May 21, 2009, the Large Quarter

FIGURE 5.10 Large Quarter Trade During a Progressive Wave
Trade can be set up with an entry price at 1.3775, a proﬁt target/exit price
at 1.3975, and a stop at 1.3665. The strong Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 com-
pletes the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000 in two days: May 21 and 22, withinthe timeframe allowed by the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory. The
Large Quarter Trade takes advantage of the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 and
the successful completion of the Large Quarter 1.3750 to 1.4000. The tradereaches its proﬁt target at 1.3975 and accomplishes its objective.
As noted earlier, Progressive Wave 2 also presents an opportunity for
a Large Quarter Trade, based on Progressive Wave 2 coinciding with theLarge Quarter 1.4000 to 1.4250. Figure 5.10 shows the Progressive Wave 2
of the bullish trend wave sequence identiﬁed earlier using the daily chart of
the EUR/USD currency pair represented on a one-hour chart. Please noteon the left-hand side of the chart that a bullish breakout above resistance
of the downward channel of Correction 1 takes prices back to the Large
Quarter Point 1.3500 and marks the end of Correction 1 and the beginningof Progressive Wave 2. Based on the characteristics of the Progressive
Waves, the new trend wave may be expected to continue the previously
established trend and push prices higher. This creates an opportunity for aLarge Quarter Trade based on the anticipation that, if successful, Progres-
sive Wave 2 should coincide with and work on the Large Quarter 1.4000
to 1.4250. Prices transition into the new Large Quarter above the Large

Quarter Point 1.4000 on May 29, 2009, the ﬁrst day when the Progressive
Wave 2 begins to work on the Large Quarter 1.4000 to 1.4250. To capi-
talize on the opportunity for completion of the Large Quarter 1.4000 to
1.4250 during Progressive Wave 2, a Large Quarter Trade can be estab-lished with an entry price at 1.4025, a proﬁt target/exit at 1.4225, and a
stop at 1.3915. In spite of a temporary pullback halfway through the Large
Quarter, prices do not reverse but consolidate, forming a Symmetrical Tri-
angle trend-continuation pattern. A bullish symmetrical triangle breakout
signals further trend wave progression, leading to the completion of theLarge Quarter 1.4000 to 1.4250 in three trading days: May 29, May 31, and
June 1 (the market was closed on Saturday, May 30, 2009). The Large Quar-
ter Trade reaches its proﬁt target at 1.4225 and achieves its objective as aresult of the successful completion of the Large Quarter 1.4000 to 1.4250
by Progressive Wave 2.
THE INVERSE LARGE QUARTER TRADE
The Inverse Large Quarter Trade is another type of Quarters Theory Tradethat has as its objective the successful completion of a Large Quarter. The
Inverse Large Quarter Trade is essentially a Large Quarter Trade taken inthe opposite direction of an existing trend. Inverse Large Quarter Trades
are designed to take advantage of countertrend price moves that may lead
to the successful completion of a Large Quarter. Because of their coun-
tertrend nature, Inverse Large Quarter Trades may be associated with a
higher degree of risk compared to Large Quarter Trades.
The Inverse Large Quarter Trades have the same structure as the Large
Quarter Trades. Each Inverse Large Quarter Trade has a realistic proﬁt tar-get of at least 200 PIPs. To secure the best possible entry price and to takefull advantage of the projected proﬁt, the entry prices of the Inverse Large
Quarter Trades should not be any farther than 25 PIPs from the Large Quar-
ter Point that serves as the starting point of the Large Quarter price move.The exit points of the Inverse Large Quarter Trades should be positioned
at or before the closest Small Quarter Point 25 PIPs ahead of the targeted
Large Quarter Point.
Similar to Large Quarter Trades, a predetermined stop price is essen-
tial to limiting the risk of Inverse Large Quarter Trades. Each Inverse LargeQuarter Trade has an exact stop price calculated according to the size ofthe realistic proﬁt target based on the 2:1 risk/reward ratio. The stop-limit
orders of each Inverse Large Quarter Trade should be placed no less than
100 PIPs from the entry price, but the stops of the Inverse Large QuarterTrades may also be expanded by up to 10 PIPs for a total of 110 PIPs in in-
stances when the entry price is exactly at the Small Quarter Point 25 PIPs
from a Large Quarter Point, in order to prevent the stop-limit price from

--- PAGE 180 ---

P1: SBT
c05 JWBT192-Yotov October 15, 2009 8:19 Printer: Yet to come
162 THE QUARTERS THEORY
coinciding with the exact number representing the End of the Hesitation
Zone 75 PIPs from the Large Quarter Point. These stop expansions are al-
lowed so that the stops of Inverse Large Quarter Trades are always placed
outside of the Hesitation Zone to protect stop-limit orders from being trig-gered while prices ﬂuctuate within it. The entry, exit, and stop prices of
Inverse Large Quarter Trades should be carefully examined to make sure
that these prices do not coincide with any of the important price points
within the Large Quarters or with any major support/resistance levels
positioned within a Large Quarter.
The Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory serves as a time stop
for each Inverse large Quarter Trade. If prices fail to complete a LargeQuarter and an Inverse Large Quarter Trade has not accomplished its goalin the time period required by the Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory
of three 24-hour trading sessions on the global foreign exchange market,
the trade may be closed by the end of the third day, or the take-proﬁt limitprice may be changed to lock in any smaller proﬁts. Also on the third day,
the stop price should be moved to a breakeven level at the initial entry
price to protect the trade against losses. If it is too late to take the above-mentioned steps, the trade may simply be closed at a smaller loss to pre-
vent prices from reaching the predetermined 100 to 110 PIP stop-limit order
that may get triggered during trend reversals as a result of the unsuccessfulcompletion of a Large Quarter.
Identical to Large Quarter Trades, Inverse Large Quarter Trades also
allow changing the stops in certain situations, depending on the advance-
ment of prices into the Large Quarter. For example, if there is a decisive
Large Quarter Transition on the ﬁrst or second day and prices have alreadyadvanced deep into the Large Quarter to the Whole Number preceding the
Large Quarter Point targeted, the stop can be moved to a breakeven level
at the initial entry price of the trade to protect against any losses, withouthaving to wait until the third day to do so. Another variation allows re-
ducing the size of the stop in half from 100 or 110 PIPs to 50 or 55 PIPs
in cases where there is a decisive Large Quarter Transition on the ﬁrstor second day that has seen prices advancing beyond the Half Point of a
Large Quarter. On the other hand, when it comes to the Three-Day Rule of
The Quarters Theory, any variations are prohibited. The Three-Day Ruleof The Quarters Theory should not be bent by allowing more than three
days for a Large Quarter completion, and the three-day time stops of the
Inverse Large Quarter Trades should be enforced very strictly to preventor minimize losses and to assure consistent trading results.
Opportunities for Inverse Large Quarter Trades are most likely to oc-
cur in a countertrend environment in periods of price corrections follow-ing a trend wave, or during consolidations in trendless, range-bound price
channels. The individual trend waves and the price corrections following

them can be identiﬁed using the methodology of The Quarters Theory
Trend Waves combined with technical analysis of price patterns, break-
outs, technical indicators, and so forth, which may be utilized for conﬁr-
mation and early warning purposes. The Fibonacci retracement levels arean important tool when attempting to establish Large Quarter Trades that
take advantage of the countertrend price moves during corrections follow-
ing trend waves. The Fibonacci retracement levels are determined by us-
ing the Fibonacci ratios to calculate 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 100%
retracements of any pullbacks in prices during correction periods. Thesemeasures of retracement percentages are based on previously established
price ranges between highs and lows of the trend waves preceding the price
correction. Future support and resistance price levels are determined bycalculating the Fibonacci retracements and can be used as potential price
targets during corrections following trend waves. The lower-range percent-
ages of 23.6% to 38.2% Fibonacci retracements are usually easier to reachand can provide more realistic future price targets that serve as practical
guidance to determine whether a Large Quarter stands a chance to be suc-
cessfully completed during a price Correction following a trend wave, andbased on that, whether there would be a realistic opportunity for an Inverse
Large Quarter Trade.
Consider the familiar daily chart of the EUR/USD currency pair in Fig-
ure 5.11, which shows the bullish trend wave cycle consisting of two trend

waves: the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 and Progressive Wave 2. Cal-
culating the lower-range Fibonacci retracement percentages up to 38.2%
would help to determine whether there is potential opportunity for an In-
verse Large Quarter Trade during Correction 1 following Reversal-TriggerWave 1. If a retracement up to 38.2% of the range of Reversal-Trigger Wave
1 is enough to see prices drop from the Large Quarter Point 1.4000 to
the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, there may be a realistic opportunity for
a Large Quarter completion and for an Inverse Large Quarter Trade. How-
ever, in this example, a 38.2% retracement should bring prices toward the1.3800 level—50 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, and therefore,
the retracement would need to exceed the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement
of the Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 in order for the Large Quarter 1.4000 to1.3750 to be completed successfully. Based on these calculations, we can
conclude that, realistically, there may not be an ideal opportunity for an
Inverse Large Quarter Trade because it may be difﬁcult to complete theLarge Quarter 1.4000 to 1.3750 during Correction 1 following the bullish
Reversal-Trigger Wave 1. A better opportunity for an Inverse Large Quar-
ter Trade in this example might have been presented during Correction 2following the Progressive Wave 2. After the end of Correction 2, there is
an attempt to continue the bullish trend wave cycle with another Conclu-
sive Wave 3. The head-and-shoulders trend-reversal pattern gives the earlywarning sign of the potential for a Wave 3 failure. Conclusive Wave 3 fails
to produce a higher high than the high of Progressive Wave 2, and as a re-
sult, a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 develops, helped by the breakout
below the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern. The development
of the bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 opens the door for prices to tar-get the Large Quarter Point 1.4000, raises the probability for completion of
the Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4000, and creates, although not ideal, a bet-
ter opportunity for an Inverse Large Quarter Trade compared to the oneconsidered during Correction 1.
The best opportunities for Inverse Large Quarter Trades usually oc-
cur during corrections following extended trend waves. Extended trendwaves that have produced large price moves are most likely to be followed
by corrections where even the lower-end, up to 38.2% Fibonacci retrace-
ment, may be sufﬁcient to complete a Large Quarter in the direction oppo-site to the previously established trend wave. Consider Figure 5.12, which
shows the EUR/USD currency pair in a bullish trend wave cycle consist-
ing of a Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 and an Extended Progressive Wave 2.Extended Progressive Wave 2 produces a signiﬁcant price move of about
1400 PIPs from the low around the Large Quarter Point 1.3000 to the high
around 1.4400. A price pullback of up to 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of thetotal 1400 PIP Range of Extended Progressive Wave 2 should bring prices
down by about 535 PIPs from the high around 1.4400, close to 1.3900. In

that case, Correction 2 following Extended Progressive Wave 2 should co-
incide with the Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4000 and, if prices pull back tothe 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, the price move would be sufﬁcient to
produce a successful completion of the Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4000. By
doing these simple calculations, one can determine whether there wouldbe a clear opportunity for an Inverse Large Quarter Trade that could take
advantage of the potential completion of the Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4000
during Correction 2. The Inverse Large Quarter trade in this example maybe set up with an entry point no lower than 1.4225, an exit/proﬁt target at
1.4025, and a stop at 1.4335—110 PIPs above the entry price—so that the
stop is positioned outside of the Hesitation Zone 75 PIPs above the LargeQuarter Point 1.4250.
Periods of consolidation, when sideways price channels and ranges
are formed, may also present some opportunities for Inverse Large Quar-ter Trades. In such instances, the range of the price channel must be large
enough to include a Large Quarter, so that the price ﬂuctuations between
the top and the bottom of the channel would be sufﬁcient for the success-ful completion of a Large Quarter. Figure 5.13 shows the EUR/CHF cur-
rency pair in a sideways channel with a range perfectly positioned between

the Large Quarter Point 1.5000, serving as the bottom of the channel, and
the top of the channel within at least one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs ahead
of the Large Quarter Point 1.5250. Double-top and double-bottom patterns
conﬁrm the range and signal price reversals from top to bottom and bot-tom to top. The price ﬂuctuations between the top and the bottom of the
channel may create an opportunity for a sequence of Large Quarter and In-
verse Large Quarter Trades. In this range-bound channel-trading example,Large Quarter Trades may be established with an entry point no higher than
1.5025 (close to the Large Quarter Point serving as the bottom of the chan-
nel), an exit/proﬁt target at 1.5225 (at least 25 PIPs from the Large Quarter

Inverse Large Quarter Trades may be set with an entry point no higher than1.5225 (at least 25 PIPs ahead of the Large Quarter Point serving as the top
of the channel), an exit/proﬁt target at 1.5025 (at least 25 PIPs ahead of

HESITATION ZONE TRADES
The Hesitation Zone Trades are Quarters Theory Trades whose objective is
to capitalize on the price moves within the Large Quarters. The Hesitation
Zone Trades take advantage of the price ﬂuctuations within the HesitationZone 75 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point. The Hesitation Zone
represents the ﬁrst three Small Quarters of each Large Quarter. Prices en-
ter this important range when they make an attempt to transition into a new
Large Quarter. Decisive price moves toward the End of the Hesitation Zone
are the ﬁrst signs of potential Large Quarter Transitions. However, pricesoften break above a Large Quarter Point and enter the Hesitation Zone
but halt their progression into the Large Quarter, especially when they en-
counter support or resistance close to the End of the Hesitation Zone. Insuch instances, prices lose their momentum; they become reluctant to con-
tinue farther into the Large Quarter and stay conﬁned within the range of
the Hesitation Zone, hence the name. While this price behavior may jeop-ardize the Large Quarter Transitions, it could also create opportunities for
“round-trip” types of trades based on the moves toward the End of the Hes-
itation Zone as well as on the reversal moves that often bring prices backtoward the preceding Large Quarter Point. The Hesitation Zone Trade and
the Hesitation Zone Reversal Trade are designed to take advantage of these
ﬂuctuations between the top and the bottom of the price channel deﬁnedby the Hesitation Zone.
The Hesitation Zone Trade capitalizes on the entrance of prices into
a new Large Quarter and the initial push above a Large Quarter Point to-
ward the End of the Hesitation Zone. Because the Hesitation Zone has a
constant range of 75 PIPs, the Hesitation Zone Trade follows a systematicstructure based on the conservative objective to capture approximately 2/3
of the range of the Hesitation Zone. This conservative model is established
due to the fact that in certain Large Quarters, the closest Whole Numberto a Large Quarter Point is positioned within the Hesitation Zone ahead
of the price point that indicates the End of the Hesitation Zone. Since the
Whole Numbers are also Major Small Quarter Points and serve as impor-tant junctions marking the end of a previous and the beginning of a new 100
PIP Range, the Whole Numbers/Major Small Quarter Points often serve as
support or resistance levels when prices attempt to transition between the100 PIP Ranges. If support or resistance is met at the Whole Number/Major
Small Quarter Point preceding the End of the Hesitation Zone, prices may
not be able to continue further and reach the End of the Hesitation Zone;therefore, any take-proﬁt orders placed in the area of the Small Quarter or
the 25 PIP Range between the Whole Number/Major Small Quarter Point
and the End of the Hesitation Zone may have difﬁculties getting ﬁlled. To

capture the majority of the 50 PIPs between a Large Quarter Point and the
Whole Number/Major Small Quarter Point preceding the End of the Hesita-
tion Zone, and to make sure that the order has a better chance to be ﬁlled
before any potential support/resistance is encountered at the Whole Num-ber/Major Small Quarter Point preceding the End of the Hesitation Zone,
each Hesitation Zone Trade should have an entry point exactly 1 PIP from
a Large Quarter Point and an exit point 5 PIPs ahead of a Whole Num-
ber/Major Small Quarter Point preceding the End of the Hesitation Zone,
or basically 5 PIPs ahead of the ﬁnal Small Quarter of the Hesitation Zone.These requirements also take into consideration the standard bid-and-ask
spreads of the major currency pairs (provided they do not exceed 5 PIPs)
and assure a conservative and easier-to-accomplish proﬁt target of exactly44 PIPs for each Hesitation Zone Trade.
The Hesitation Zone Trade has a ﬁxed stop of 30 PIPs that limits losses.
Although the preferred risk/reward ratio for the Large Quarter Trades is2:1, based on the 44 PIPs proﬁt target, the stop of the Hesitation Zone trade
falls within the lines of the 1.5:1 risk/reward ratio because of the need for
the stop to be extended to make sure that each stop of the Hesitation ZoneTrade is large enough so that it is always positioned outside of the 25 PIP
Range of the Overshoot Area above or below a Large Quarter Point.

Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4500 and enters the Hesitation Zone between
the Large Quarter Point 1.4250 and the End of the Hesitation Zone at
1.4325. The Large Quarter Transition creates an opportunity for a Hesita-
tion Zone Trade that would capitalize on the price move toward the Endof the Hesitation Zone. The Hesitation Zone of the Large Quarter 1.4250
to 1.4500 contains the Whole Number/Major Small Quarter Point 1.4300,
creating a risk that, if prices were to encounter resistance at the Whole
Number/Major Small Quarter Point 1.4300 preceding the End of the Hesita-
tion Zone, the End of the Hesitation Zone might not be reached. To capturethe majority of the 50 PIPs between the Large Quarter Point 1.4250 and

of the Hesitation Zone 1.4325, and to make sure that the order has a betterchance to be ﬁlled before any potential support/resistance is encountered
at the Whole Number/Major Small Quarter Point 1.4300, a Hesitation Zone
Trade in this example may be set up with an entry point at 1.4251—1 PIPabove the Large Quarter Point (the closest price point next to the start-
ing Large Quarter Point of the new Large Quarter 1.4250 to 1.4500)—and
an exit point at 1.4295 (5 PIPs ahead of the Whole Number/Major SmallQuarter Point 1.4300, or 5 PIPs ahead of the ﬁnal 25 PIPs Small Quarter of
the Hesitation Zone). These conservative parameters would establish what
could be an easier-to-accomplish proﬁt target of 44 PIPs that would not re-quire prices to reach the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.4325 by producing a
breakout above the Whole Number/Major Small Quarter Point 1.4300 and
overshooting it by up to 25 PIPs. Based on the proﬁt target, the stop price
may be placed at 1.4221—30 PIPs below the entry price—which would be
a sufﬁcient amount of PIPs to position the stop outside of the OvershootArea 25 PIPs below the Large Quarter Point 1.4250. Note in Figure 5.14
that since prices indeed encounter resistance at the Whole Number/Small
Quarter Point 1.4300, fail to reach the End of the Hesitation Zone 1.4325,and reverse back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point 1.4250, a Hesi-
tation Zone Trade with a larger, more aggressive proﬁt target placed above
the Whole Number/Small Quarter Point 1.4300 in this example might haveended up being unsuccessful.
The opportunities for Hesitation Zone Trades are identiﬁed using the
methodology of The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory TrendWaves combined with technical analysis of price patterns, breakouts, tech-
nical indicators, and so forth, which may be utilized for conﬁrmation and
early warning purposes. Naturally, the ﬁrst and most obvious signs of thepotential for Hesitation Zone Trades are always the price moves approach-
ing a Large Quarter Point in an attempt to produce a new Large Quarter
Transition. Since the Hesitation Zone Trade’s realistic objective is to cap-ture 44 PIPs proﬁt, such price moves could occur within minutes; there-
fore, smaller, faster-reacting time-period charts, such as the Ten-Minute

chart, should be used to analyze Hesitation Zone trading opportunities. In
Figure 5.15, a careful analysis of the ten-minute chart of the AUD/USD cur-
rency pair reveals that a bullish breakout of a triple top resistance a few
PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 0.8000 causes a decisive attempt for
transition into a new Large Quarter 0.8000 to 0.8250. The breakout leads tothe development of a bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 during which prices
reenter the Hesitation Zone 75 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 0.8000,
after pulling back and consolidating within the Overshoot Area 25 PIPsbelow the Large Quarter Point 0.8000. The transition of prices above the
Large Quarter Point 0.8000 creates an opportunity for a Hesitation Zone
Trade that might take advantage of the price move toward the End of theHesitation Zone 0.8075 that could occur during the bullish trend wave cy-
cle. As prices pull back during Correction 1 following the bullish Reversal-
Trigger Wave 1, they ﬁnd support at the previous triple top resistance. Thesupport signals the beginning of another bullish Progressive Wave 2, which
continues the bullish trend wave cycle and makes the push toward the End
of the Hesitation Zone 0.8075. Using the familiar conservative parameters,a Hesitation Zone Trade in this example may be established with an entry
point at 0.8001—1 PIP above the Major Large Quarter Point 0.8000—and
an exit point at 0.8045 (5 PIPs ahead of the ﬁnal 25 PIPs Small Quarter ofthe Hesitation Zone). The stop in this instance may be placed at 0.7971—30
PIPs below the Large Quarter Point 0.8000—to make sure that the stop is
positioned outside the Overshoot area 25 PIPs below the Large Quarter

Point 0.8000. Note that despite prices failing to reach the exact end of the
Hesitation Zone at 0.8075, the conservative parameters would have, once
again, contributed to the success of this example’s Hesitation Zone Trade.
Instances when prices encounter support or resistance close to the
End of the Hesitation Zone and reverse back toward the preceding LargeQuarter Point can create an ideal environment for Hesitation Zone Rever-
sal Trades. Hesitation Zone Reversal Trades are basically inverse Hesita-
tion Zone Trades that take advantage of the reversal price moves from the
top (or bottom) of the range of the Hesitation Zone targeting the precedingLarge Quarter Point. Hesitation Zone Reversal Trades have the same con-
servative proﬁt target of 44 PIPs as Hesitation Zone Trades. The optimal
parameters that warrant a realistic objective and more consistent resultsrequire each Hesitation Zone Reversal Trade to comply with the following:
entry point 20 PIPs from the End of the Hesitation Zone to make sure that
the entry orders do not require prices to reach the exact End of the Hesita-tion Zone, exit point 11 PIPs above the targeted Large Quarter Point to as-
sure an easier order ﬁll without the need for prices to reach the actual Large
Quarter Point, and a stop 30 PIPs above (or below) the End of the Hesita-tion Zone, so that the stop is always placed outside of the Hesitation Zone.
Figure 5.16 shows a Hesitation Zone Reversal Trade. Let us analyze
the same AUD/USD currency pair ten-minute chart. As explained previ-ously, the bullish trend wave sequence that starts as a result of a bullish

172 THE QUARTERS THEORY
breakout presents an opportunity for a Hesitation Zone Trade that takes ad-
vantage of the price move from the Large Quarter Point 0.8000 toward the
End of the Hesitation Zone at 0.8075. However, prices encounter resistance
ahead of the End of the Hesitation Zone, which creates an opportunityfor a Hesitation Zone Reversal Trade that could capitalize on the reversal
price move that could take prices back toward the preceding Large Quar-
ter Point 0.8000. The failure of Conclusive Wave 3 to break above the high
of Progressive Wave 2 and to continue the bullish trend wave cycle leads
to the development of a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1, which conﬁrmsthe reversal. The bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 is then followed by a
Correction sequence shaped like a symmetrical triangle trend-continuation
pattern, signaling further progression of the decline toward the precedingLarge Quarter Point 0.8000. A potential Hesitation Zone Reversal Trade that
capitalizes on the aforementioned developments may be set up with the fol-
lowing conservative parameters: entry point at 0.8055 (20 PIPs below theEnd of the Hesitation Zone), exit point at 0.8011 (11 PIPs above the tar-
geted Large Quarter Point 0.8000), and a stop at 0.8085 (30 PIPs above the
End of the Hesitation Zone 0.8075, so that the stop is placed outside of theHesitation Zone).
Technical indicators can provide early warning and conﬁrmation sig-
nals when exploring Hesitation Zone Trade and Hesitation Zone Rever-sal Trade opportunities. In Figure 5.17, the bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave
1 begins the bullish trend wave cycle at the time when the RSI shows

normal conditions and the 10-period moving average sends a bullish sig-
nal by crossing above the 20-period moving average. During the pullback
of Correction 1, prices ﬁnd support at the 10-period moving average—a
development that signals that Correction 1 may be ending and that an-other bullish Progressive Wave 2 may develop in an attempt to continue
the bullish trend wave cycle. Note also that the bullish trend wave cycle
ends shortly after the RSI and the fast stochastic indicators breach above
70 and 80—the levels signaling overbought conditions, which can be used
as early warning signs that the bullish trend may reverse.
OVERSHOOT TRADES
TheOvershoot Trades are highly speculative, active trades that are de-
signed to take advantage of overshoots. The Quarters Theory considersprice moves of 25 PIPs or less above or below a Large Quarter Point, the
important price points within a Large Quarter, Whole Numbers, or any ma-
jor support/resistance price points to be overshoots. Overshoots usuallyoccur as a result of attempts by prices to break above or below these signif-
icant price levels. One of the main characteristics of overshoots is that they
are often followed by reversals toward the preceding price point above orbelow which the overshoot has developed. The overshoots and the pull-
backs that follow them provide opportunities for Overshoot Trades and
Overshoot Reversal Trades.
Overshoots of Large Quarter Points, Whole Numbers, and the impor-
tant price points within a Large Quarter create the most favorable environ-ment for Overshoot Trades and Overshoot Reversal Trades. Overshoots of
major support/resistance levels may present some good chances also, but
there is a greater risk for violent, erratic price moves to occur as the mar-ket attempts to challenge and break the support or resistance of these price
levels, leading to much greater volatility that could easily trigger the stops
of Overshoot Trades and Overshoot Reversal Trades. No matter the pricepoint at which an overshoot develops, the amount of PIPs that is likely
to be produced during overshoots is very difﬁcult to predict, because the
overshoots are not exactly decisive price moves, but rather either “priceinertia” from a previous move, or simply “wiggle” price moves with short
irregular motions around an important price level. The unpredictability fac-
tor of overshoots is much greater compared with other trading opportuni-ties, as an overshoot can bring forth a few or sometimes a single PIP and
can be immediately followed by a reversal. This is why Overshoot Trades
are highly speculative, “scalping” trades with tight stops and very conser-vative proﬁt targets.
The Overshoot Area of a Large Quarter Point, the important price
points within a Large Quarter, the Whole Numbers, or any major support/

--- PAGE 192 ---

174 THE QUARTERS THEORY
resistance price points have a clearly deﬁned range of up to 25 PIPs imple-
mented by The Quarters Theory so that overshoots are properly identiﬁed.
To capture the majority of that range without requiring an overshoot to
reach the end of its 25 PIPs range, Overshoot Trades should comply withthe following conservative parameters. Considering the characteristics of
overshoots, to ensure the best possible entry price, each Overshoot Trade
should have an entry point 1 PIP from the price point above or below
which the overshoot is expected to occur. The exit points of Overshoot
Trades should be set 10 PIPs ahead of the end of the Overshoot Area,which results in a conservative proﬁt target no greater than 14 PIPs for
each Overshoot Trade. In order to allow some wiggle room, the stops of the
Overshoot Trades should be placed as far as possible from the price pointthat is being overshot, without negatively affecting the risk/reward ratio
of the trade. The most suitable risk/reward ratio in the case would be ap-
proximately 1.5:1, which means that the stops of Overshoot Trades may bepositioned no farther than 10 PIPs from the entry point. Overshoot Trades
should not be left unattended—they are scalping trades and require close
monitoring and the ability to react quickly in the event of a sudden pricereversal that might occur before an Overshoot Trade has reached its target.
Opportunities for Overshoot Trades are identiﬁed using the methodol-
ogy of The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory Trend Waves com-bined with technical analysis. Technical indicators can be applied, but
some of them, especially lagging indicators such as moving averages, may
not be able to give fast enough signals as they could lag behind the rapid
price moves or spikes during overshoots. Because Overshoot Trades are
very quick in-and-out speculative trades, time is of the essence; therefore,fast-reacting time-period charts (e.g., ﬁve-minute or even smaller time-
frame charts such as three- or even one-minute charts) should be utilized
to analyze and spot Overshoot Trading opportunities. Price behavior inthe vicinity of a targeted price point—breakouts, support/resistance, trend
wave continuation or reversals, chart patterns, and so forth—can provide
the necessary signals for Overshoot Trades.
For example, as shown in Figure 5.18, a quick analysis of the ﬁve-
minute chart of the EUR/USD currency pair reveals that prices ﬂatten afew PIPs ahead of the Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000 as they approachit. Knowing how important the Large Quarter Points are, especially the
Major Large Quarter Points, it would make sense to anticipate that the
Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000 might serve as a signiﬁcant level of resis-tance and that a breakout above 1.4000 might not be successful on its ﬁrst
attempt. This means that prices may wiggle around the Major Large Quar-
ter Point 1.4000 for a while and may produce overshoots above or belowthis important price level until a decisive breakout is ﬁnally accomplished.
The expected overshoot above the Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000 could

FIGURE 5.18 Overshoot Trade
continue the ﬁve-minute chart’s bullish trend wave cycle and could create
an opportunity for a quick Overshoot Trade. Complying with the conserva-
tive parameters of Overshoot Trades, in this example, a trade with a real-
istic proﬁt target no higher than 14 PIPs may be established with an entry
point at 1.4001 (1 PIP above the Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000) and an
exit point no further than 1.4015 (10 PIPs ahead of the end of the OvershootArea at 1.4025). Based on the proﬁt target and the 1.5:1 risk/reward ratio,
a stop may be placed no further than 1.3991 (maximum 10 PIPs below the
entry point).
Overshoots that do not evolve into decisive price breakouts can pro-
vide excellent opportunities for Overshoot Reversal Trades. The name ofthe Overshoot Reversal Trades says it all: They rely on the reversals that oc-cur during overshoots as prices pull back toward the preceding price point
above or below which the overshoot has developed. The requirements that
must be met when spotting Overshoot Reversal Trade opportunities arethat an overshoot must occur, and that during the overshoot prices must
remain within and must never exit the Overshoot Area. The essence of
Overshoot Reversal Trades is that they are based on the premise of purespeculation that an overshoot is not going to lead to a decisive breakout
that would cause prices to move over 25 PIPs above or below the targeted
price level, and that the overshoot is likely be followed by a reversal. Iden-tical to Overshoot Trades, Overshoot Reversal Trades are quick scalping
trades and should be monitored closely.

176 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Considering the characteristics of overshoots, to ensure the best
possible entry prices and realistic proﬁt targets that are easier to reach
consistently, each Overshoot Reversal Trade should comply with the fol-
lowing parameters. The entry points of Overshoot Reversal Trades shouldbe placed within 6 PIPs from the end of the Overshoot Area. The exit points
of the Overshoot Trades should be placed at least 5 PIPs ahead of the im-
portant price point that has been overshot. These parameters generate a
conservative proﬁt target of 14 PIPs for each Overshoot Reversal Trade. In
order to make sure that the stops are always placed outside of the Over-shoot Area, without negatively affecting the risk/reward ratios, the stops
of the Overshoot Reversal Trades should be positioned up to 10 PIPs from
the entry point.
Let us analyze the same ﬁve-minute chart of the EUR/USD currency
pair used in the previous example. The Overshoot above the Major LargeQuarter Point 1.4000 takes prices a few PIPs away from the end of the Over-shoot Area. As a result of the failure of the bullish Wave 2 to break above
the previous high of Wave 1, prices remain within and never exit the Over-
shoot Area. A double top trend-reversal pattern is established, signaling areversal and the potential for a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 to take
prices back toward the overshot Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000. The an-
ticipated reversal creates an opportunity for a quick Overshoot ReversalTrade. Complying with the conservative parameters of Overshoot Reversal
Trades, shown in Figure 5.19, a trade with a realistic proﬁt target no higher

than 14 PIPs may be established with an entry point at 1.4019 (6 PIPs ahead
of the end of the Overshoot Area 1.4025) and an exit point at 1.4005 (at least
5 PIPs ahead of the Major Large Quarter Point 1.4000). Based on the proﬁt
target and the 1.5:1 risk/reward ratio, a stop may be placed at 1.4029 toposition it outside of the Overshoot Area, a maximum 10 PIPs above the
entry point.
HALF POINT TRADES
The Half Point Trades are Quarters Theory Trades whose objective is to
capitalize on the price moves within the Large Quarters. The Half Point
Trades take advantage of the price ﬂuctuations between a Large Quarter
Point and the Half Point of a Large Quarter. The Half Point is an importantprice level that marks the exact middle price point of each Large Quar-
ter. Price moves that stretch outside of the Hesitation Zone and reach the
Half Point of a Large Quarter provide the conﬁrmation signal of a success-ful Large Quarter Transition. On the other hand, the Half Point can also
play the role of a problematic price point that may avert the successful
completion of a Large Quarter. Instances when the Half Point becomes adifﬁcult support or resistance level to overcome and prevents further pro-
gression of prices beyond the Half Point could lead to price exhaustion and
unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter. Strong support or resistance
met at the Half Point of a Large Quarter might cause a reversal that could
take prices back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point. The Half PointTrade and the Half Point Reversal Trade are designed to take advantage
of these price moves from a Large Quarter Point to a Half Point and the
reversals targeting a Large Quarter Point.
The Half Point Trades at a ﬁrst glance may seem to take place within
the context of Large Quarters Trades, but there is a signiﬁcant differencebetween the two. While Large Quarter Trades anticipate the successfulcompletion of a Large Quarter, Half Point Trades are based on the expec-
tation that support or resistance met at the Half Point may be difﬁcult to
break, may avert further progression of prices, and may lead to the unsuc-cessful completion of a Large Quarter. What validates such expectations
even more are instances when major support/resistance levels coincide
with the actual Half Points or the close proximity of up to 25 PIPs aroundthem. To anticipate the successful completion of a Large Quarter that con-
tains major support/resistance levels coinciding with the Half Point or its
vicinity might not be the most realistic high-probability proposition in suchcases, and therefore opting for a Half Point Trade instead of a Large Quar-
ter Trade may be the better, more conservative alternative.

178 THE QUARTERS THEORY
The success of a Half Point Trade depends on whether a Large Quar-
ter Transition will produce a decisive price move targeting the Half Point
of a Large Quarter. There is a constant price range of exactly 125 PIPs
that separates a Large Quarter Point from the Half Point of a Large Quar-ter. Half Point Trades are designed to capture the majority of that range
without the need for an overshoot of a Whole Number that may precede a
Half Point. In order to consistently accomplish their objectives, Half Point
Trades should comply with the following conservative parameters. To en-
sure the best possible entry/exit prices and order ﬁlls, each Half PointTrade should have an entry point no farther than 15 PIPs from a Large
Quarter Point that serves as a starting point of a Large Quarter price move,
and an exit point set 30 PIPs ahead of the end of the targeted Half Point.This exit point assures that the exit price will always be positioned at least
5 PIPs ahead of a Whole Number preceding a Half Point. These parameters
would produce a conservative proﬁt target no greater than 80 PIPs for eachHalf Point Trade. So that they are always positioned outside of the Over-
shoot area 25 PIPs above or below a Large Quarter Point, the stops of Half
Point Trades should be placed up to 45 PIPs from the entry point. Basedon the proﬁt target and stop ranges, the Half Point Trades approximately
comply with the 2:1 risk/reward ratio.
Half Point Trade opportunities are identiﬁed using the methodology
of The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory Trend Waves com-bined with technical analysis. The one-hour charts are the preferred time-
frames to help monitor price behavior and recognize breakouts, sup-
port/resistance, chart patterns, trend wave development, reversals, and so
forth. Figure 5.20 shows the one-hour chart of the AUD/USD currency pair.A bullish trend wave on the left-hand side of the chart pushes prices to
an overshoot above the Large Quarter Point 0.8000. As prices reverse after
the overshoot, the bullish trend wave sequence ends, but instead of a bear-ish cycle establishing, prices ﬁnd support twice above the Large Quarter
Point, developing a double bottom. The double-bottom reversal pattern sig-
nals the potential for prices to continue higher with a new bullish trendwave cycle that begins with the development of a bullish Reversal-Trigger
Wave 1. The fact that prices remain above the Large Quarter Point 0.8000
during the pullback and form a double bottom is a sign of strength andincreases the probability that prices will make an attempt to produce a de-
cisive Large Quarter Transition into the new Large Quarter 0.8000 to 0.8250.
The Half Point of the Large Quarter may be targeted during such a LargeQuarter Transition attempt and therefore a Half Point Trade as a conserva-
tive alternative to a Large Quarter Trade may be considered in this exam-
ple. A Half Point Trade with a realistic proﬁt target no higher than 80 PIPsmay be established with an entry point at 0.8015 (no further than 15 PIPs
above the Major Large Quarter Point 0.8000) and an exit point at 0.8095

(at least 5 PIPs ahead of the Whole Number 0.8100 preceding the Half Point
0.8125). Based on the proﬁt target and the 2:1 risk/reward ratio, a stop may
be placed no further than 0.7970 (up to 45 PIPs below the entry point sothat the stop is positioned outside of the Overshoot Area 25 PIPs below the
Major Large Quarter Point 0.8000).
Even better and less likely to be confused with the Large Quarter
Trades are the opportunities created by reversals at or around a Half Point.These reversals lead to the unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter and
result in price pullbacks toward the preceding Large Quarter Point, creat-ing an ideal environment for the Half Point Reversal Trades. The objective
of Half Point Reversal Trades is to capture the majority of the up to 125
PIPs reversal moves from a Half Point to a Large Quarter Point. Consider-ing that in some Large Quarters the Half Point is positioned only 25 PIPs
ahead of the Whole Number preceding the targeted Large Quarter Point,
the stops of Half Point Reversal Trades must always be placed outside ofthe 25 PIPs area between these two important price points within the Large
Quarter. This means that the entry price of Half Point Reversal Trades must
be placed ahead of the Half Point and that the stops of Half Point Rever-sal Trades must be placed far enough from the entry point to assure that
the stops are positioned not only past the Half Point but also beyond the

180 THE QUARTERS THEORY
Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point. To meet these require-
ments, the entry point of Half Point Reversal Trades may be placed up to
10 PIPs ahead of the Half Point and the stops of the Half Point Reversal
Trades may be placed up to 50 PIPs from the entry point. As an attempt toresolve the need for an exit point that would be easier to reach consistently,
Half Point Reversal Trades may have their exit points set up to 25 PIPs
ahead of a targeted Large Quarter Point. These parameters result in a con-
servatively estimated proﬁt target of 90 PIPs, close enough to comply with
the preferred 2:1 risk/reward ratio for Half Point Reversal Trades.
The methodology of The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory
Trend Waves combined with technical analysis should be utilized whenidentifying Half Point Reversal Trade opportunities. Early warning signs ofpotential reversals can be recognized by examining the one-hour chart for
trend-reversal patterns—double or multiple tops/bottoms, head and shoul-
ders, and so forth—as well as for signs of a Trend Wave Failure in closeproximity to a Half Point. Let us take a look at the same one-hour chart of
the AUD/USD currency pair used in the previous example (see Figure 5.21).
The double-bottom pattern signals and upward price move and the devel-opment of a new bullish trend wave cycle that sees the bullish Reversal-
Trigger Wave 1 and the bullish Progressive Wave 2 targeting to the Half
Point 0.8125. A small overshoot above the Half Point 0.8125 is followed by

a price Correction 2 (C2) that ends Progressive Wave 2. After Correction
2 (C2), another bullish Conclusive Wave 3 develops; however, Conclusive
Wave 3 meets resistance at the Half Point and fails to break above the high
of Progressive Wave 2. The failure of Conclusive Wave 3 signals potentialreversal and leads to the development of a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave
1. The bullish Trend Wave Failure and the inability of prices to continue
farther into the Large Quarter beyond the Half Point creates an ideal en-
vironment for a Half Point Reversal trade that may take advantage of the
unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter and the reversal that couldtake prices back toward the preceding Large Quarter Point. Such a Half
Point Reversal Trade may be established with an entry point at 0.8115
(10 PIPs ahead of the Half Point 0.8125) and an exit point at 0.8025(25 PIPs ahead of the Large Quarter Point 0.8000) for a conservative proﬁt
target of 90 PIPs. To position the stop above the Half Point, complying with
the preferred 2:1 risk/reward ratio, a stop may be placed at 0.8165 (up to50 PIPs above the entry point).
Technical indicators can offer useful conﬁrmation and early warning
signals of reversals that may create opportunities for Half Point ReversalTrades. In Figure 5.22, a bullish cross of price above the ﬁve-period expo-
nential moving average conﬁrms the development of the bullish Reversal-
Trigger Wave 1, beginning the new bullish trend wave cycle that challenges

the Half Point 0.8125. On the other hand, an RSI reading above 70 signals
overbought conditions and gives the early warning sign of a potential re-
versal. The bearish cross of price below the ﬁve-period exponential moving
average conﬁrms the reversal and the development of a bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 that takes prices back toward the preceding Large Quarter
Point 0.8000.
WHOLE NUMBER TRADES
The name “Whole Number Trades” is short for the Whole Number preced-
ing a Large Quarter Point Trade. The Whole Number Trades include the
Whole Number Trade and the Whole Number Reversal Trade. The Whole
Number Trade capitalizes on the price moves within a Large Quarter thattarget the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point. The Whole
Number Reversal Trades take advantage of the reversals that may occur
when the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point plays the role ofthe last problematic price point that prevents the successful completion of
a Large Quarter. Support or resistance encountered at the Whole Number
preceding a Large Quarter Point have the potential to avert further progres-sion of prices and may lead to price exhaustion, unsuccessful completion
of a Large Quarter, and a reversal back toward the preceding Large Quarter
Point. These reversals targeting the preceding Large Quarter Point create
the ideal environment for Whole Number Reversal Trades.
Whole Number Trades are designed as a more conservative alternative
to Large Quarter Trades in instances when a major support/resistance levelcoincides with a Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point or falls
within the close proximity of 25 PIPs around it. Major support/resistancelevels positioned within the range of a Large Quarter lessen the odds that
such a Large Quarter will be successfully completed. Based on the antici-
pation of unsuccessful completion of a Large Quarter that contains majorsupport/resistance levels coinciding with the Whole Number preceding the
Large Quarter Point, a Whole Number Trade may be chosen to take ad-
vantage of the Large Quarter move that may not produce the successfulcompletion of the Large Quarter, but may be sufﬁcient enough to reach
the vicinity of the Whole Number preceding the Large Quarter Point and
challenge a previously established major support/resistance level near it.
Figure 5.23 shows a Major Mid-Term Resistance level near the Whole
Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750 on the one-hourchart of the EUR/USD currency pair dating back to March 2009. Twomonths later, in May 2009, prices approach the Large Quarter Point 1.3500
and make an attempt to transition into the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750.

FIGURE 5.23 Major Resistance Level Coinciding with the Whole Number Preced-
ing a Large Quarter Point
The fact that the new Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 contains the Major
Mid-Term Resistance level that coincides with the Whole Number 1.3700preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750 increases the likelihood that
steep resistance encountered at the Whole Number 1.3700 or the area
around it may prevent the successful completion of the Large Quarter1.3500 to 1.3750. In this instance, there is a great probability that although
prices may not complete the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 on the ﬁrst
try, at least they might produce a decisive move within the Large Quar-ter in an attempt to challenge the previously established Major Mid-Term
Resistance level that coincides with the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding
the Large Quarter Point 1.3750. Based on these circumstances and expec-tations, a Whole Number Trade rather than a Large Quarter Trade may be
the more realistic and conservative option to capitalize on any signiﬁcant
price moves above the Large Quarter Point 1.3500.
Whole Number Trades are designed to capture the majority of the
range between a Large Quarter Point that marks the beginning of a LargeQuarter price move and the Whole Number preceding the Large QuarterPoint that is expected to be targeted. A major factor to consider when
establishing the parameters of the Whole Number Trades is the variable

184 THE QUARTERS THEORY
positioning of the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point in dif-
ferent Large Quarters. In some Large Quarters, the distance between the
Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point and the actual Large Quar-
ter Point is 100 PIPs, while in others the distance is 50 PIPs. The LargeQuarters that have only 50 PIPs distance between the Whole Number pre-
ceding a Large Quarter Point and the actual Large Quarter Point may
be easier to complete. Moreover, Whole Number Trades taken within the
range of such Large Quarters would have larger proﬁt targets because the
range between the Large Quarter Point that marks the beginning of theseLarge Quarters and the Whole Number preceding the targeted Large Quar-
ter Point is 200 PIPs. The Large Quarters where the distance between the
Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point and the actual Large Quar-ter Point is 100 PIPs would have smaller Whole Number Trade proﬁt targets
because the range between the Large Quarter Point that marks the begin-
ning of these Large Quarters and the Whole Number preceding the LargeQuarter Point that is expected to be targeted is 150 PIPs—50 PIPs less than
the other type of Large Quarters.
Despite the smaller proﬁt targets in some Large Quarters, all Whole
Number Trades should comply with the same conservative parameters.In an effort to accomplish easier order ﬁlls and more consistently obtain-
able and realistic objectives, each Whole Number Trade should have anentry point no farther than 15 PIPs from a Large Quarter Point that serves
as a starting point of a Large Quarter price move, and an exit point set
35 PIPs ahead of the end of the targeted Whole Number preceding a Large
Quarter Point. Such an exit price ensures that the exit point of the trade
will always be positioned at least 10 PIPs ahead of a Half Point in certainLarge Quarters where the Half Point is only 25 PIPs ahead of the Whole
Number preceding the Large Quarter Point, without the need for prices to
reach or overshoot the Half Point in order for the trade to reach its tar-get. These parameters result in a conservative proﬁt target of 150 PIPs for
each Whole Number Trade. Since the entry point would be no further than
15 PIPs from a Large Quarter Point, all stops must be positioned outside ofthe Overshoot Area 25 PIPs above or below the Large Quarter Point that
serves as the starting point of a Whole Number Trade. To ensure that, the
stops of the Whole Number Trades should be placed up to 50 PIPs awayfrom the entry point. Based on the proﬁt target and the stop ranges, Whole
Number Trades offer an attractive 3:1 risk/reward ratio.
Whole Number Trade opportunities are identiﬁed using the methodol-
ogy of The Quarters Theory and The Quarters Theory Trend Waves com-bined with technical analysis. The success of the Whole Number Trades
is dependent on signiﬁcant price moves of approximately 150 to 200 PIPs(depending on the type of Large Quarter), which may take a few days to
produce. This is why day-to-day price behavior, trend waves, and trend

cycles should be analyzed using the daily charts of the currency pairs being
monitored. The individual trend waves and trend wave cycles recognized
on the daily charts can be dissected for a closer look using the one-hour
charts, which may be also utilized to provide some early warning signals oftrend reversals, breakouts, support/resistance, chart patterns, and so forth.
As shown in the previous example, the EUR/USD currency pair’s ex-
change rate enters a new Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750, containing a Major
Mid-Term Resistance level that coincides with the Whole Number 1.3700
preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750. Assuming that a Whole NumberTrade is considered based on the expectation that prices may not be able
to complete the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750, but may try to challenge
the previously established Major Mid-Term Resistance level that coincideswith the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750,
let us try to discover more pros or cons for this potential trading oppor-
tunity by examining the individual phases of trend development and pro-gression during which such a Whole Number Trade would take place. The
left-hand side of the daily chart in Figure 5.24 shows the EUR/USD pair be-
ginning a new bullish trend wave cycle that starts with a bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 developing as a result of a previous bearish wave’s failure.
The bullish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1 completes the Large Quarter 1.3000

to 1.3250 and is followed by Progressive Wave 2 and Conclusive Wave 3,
which complete another Large Quarter 1.3250 to 1.3500. Conclusive Wave
3 also makes an attempt to work on the Large Quarter in question—the
Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. Several factors may cause concern in thisinstance. First, there has already been a completion of a previous Large
Quarter during Conclusive Wave 3 and, realistically, Conclusive Wave 3
may not be capable of completing another Large Quarter, which in this
case would be the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750, especially when there is
a Major Mid-Term Resistance at the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding thetargeted Large Quarter Point 1.3750 that could cause exhaustion and end
Conclusive Wave 3. Second, if Conclusive Wave 3 is not able to complete
the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750, any additional Consecutive trend wavesthat may follow Consecutive Wave 3 would indicate that the bullish trend
wave cycle is becoming extended, which raises the probability of a Trend
Wave Failure looming over the Conclusive trend waves. This means thatthe odds that the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 would be completed dur-
ing any Consecutive trend waves may also be rather slim. Moreover, the
Major Mid-Term Resistance at the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the tar-geted Large Quarter Point 1.3750 could very well cause price exhaustion
and contribute to the failure of such Consecutive trend waves. Based on
this analysis, a Whole Number Trade that could take advantage of the pricemove that might challenge the resistance coinciding with the Whole Num-
ber 1.3700 preceding the targeted Large Quarter Point 1.3750 would be a
better, more conservative choice than choosing a Large Quarter Trade.
Now let us take a closer look at the bullish Conclusive Wave 3 using
the one-hour chart of the EUR/USD pair. In Figure 5.25, prices approachthe Large Quarter Point 1.3500, pull back a little, and then enter the Large
Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. To capitalize on the anticipated Large Quarter
Transition and the price move that might target the Major Mid-Term Resis-tance level that coincides with the Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the
Large Quarter Point 1.3750, a Whole Number Trade may be established
with the following conservative parameters: an entry point at 1.3515 (nofurther than 15 PIPs above the Large Quarter Point 1.3500) and an exit
point at 1.3665 (35 PIPs ahead of the major resistance level coinciding with
Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750). Based onthe proﬁt target and the 3:1 risk/reward ratio, a stop may be placed no fur-
ther than 1.3465 (up to 50 PIPs below the entry point so that the stop is
positioned outside of the Overshoot area 25 PIPs below the Large QuarterPoint 1.3500).
The reversals that occur when prices encounter support or resistance
at the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point and cause the unsuc-cessful completion of a Large Quarter followed by price pullbacks toward
the preceding Large Quarter Point, create the ideal environment for Whole

Number Reversal Trades. The objective of Whole Number Reversal Trades
is to capture the majority of the reversal price moves. Although the proﬁt
targets of Whole Number Reversal Trades may differ depending on the type
of Large Quarters, all Whole Number Reversal Trades follow the same con-servative parameters. Each Whole Number Reversal Trade should have an
entry point no farther than 15 PIPs from a Whole Number preceding a Large
Quarter Point that serves as a starting point of the reversal preventing thesuccessful completion of a Large Quarter. To achieve more consistent re-
sults and easier order ﬁlls, an exit point should be set 35 PIPs ahead of the
targeted Large Quarter Point during the reversal. This equals a conserva-tive proﬁt target of 150 PIPs for each Whole Number Reversal Trade. To
avoid being triggered during overshoots of the Whole Number preceding
a Large Quarter Point, the stops must be positioned outside of the Over-shoot Area 25 PIPs above or below the Whole Number preceding a Large
Quarter Point that serves as the starting point of a Whole Number Rever-
sal Trade. To ensure that, the stops of the Whole Number Reversal Tradesshould be placed up to 50 PIPs away from the entry point. Based on these
parameters, Whole Number Reversal Trades are designed to offer a 3:1 risk/
reward ratio.

Waves combined with technical analysis. Major support/resistance levels
coinciding with the Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point and
early warning signs of potential reversals can be recognized by examining
the daily and the one-hour charts for trend-reversal patterns—double ormultiple tops/bottoms, head and shoulders, and so forth—as well as for
signs of a Trend Wave Failure in close proximity to the Whole Number pre-
ceding a Large Quarter Point. For example, let us use the same daily chart
analyzed previously, which shows the EUR/USD in a strong bullish trend
wave cycle that challenges the major Mid-Term Resistance coinciding withthe Whole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750 during
Conclusive Wave 3 (see Figure 5.26). While Conclusive Wave 3 and the fol-
lowing Consecutive Wave 4 manage to target the resistance at the WholeNumber 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750, they both fail
to produce a breakout and respectively fail to complete the Large Quar-
ter 1.3500 to 1.3750. Moreover, the short-lived Consecutive Wave 4 is fol-lowed by another Consecutive Wave 5, which fails to break above the high
of the previous wave. The failure of Consecutive Wave 5 ends the bullish
trend wave cycle and signals a corrective reversal that begins with a bear-ish Reversal-Trigger Wave 1. Another sign that conﬁrms the reversal is the
development of a head-and-shoulders pattern where the high of Wave 3

serves as the left shoulder, the high of Wave 4 is the head, and the high of
Wave 5 is the right shoulder. The reversal and the bearish Reversal-TriggerWave 1 are also conﬁrmed by the bearish breakout below the neck of the
head-and-shoulders formation.
Technical indicators can offer useful conﬁrmation and early warning
signals of reversals when analyzing potential opportunities for Whole Num-ber Reversal Trades. In Figure 5.27, while a bullish cross of the 10-period
moving average over the 20-period moving average conﬁrms the strengthof the bullish Conclusive Wave 3, a bearish cross of the 10-period moving
average below the 20-period moving average offers the necessary conﬁrma-
tion of the reversal as a result of the resistance encountered at the WholeNumber 1.3700 and the development of the bearish Reversal-Trigger Wave
1. The RSI indicator reading above 70 signals overbought conditions and
provides the early warning sign of potential reversal.
An even closer look, using the one-hour chart of the EUR/USD pair in
Figure 5.28, shows multiple failed attempts for a breakout above the majorMid-Term Resistance coinciding with the Whole Number 1.3700 precedingthe Large Quarter Point 1.3750. Another important warning sign of a pos-
sible reversal that could occur as a result of the unsuccessful completion

of the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750 can be recognized by applying the
Three-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory to conﬁrm that the Large Quar-
ter has not been completed by the end of the third trading session sincethe transition of prices into the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750. All of the
above examined trend developments, price patterns, and technical indi-
cators reveal the potential for a Whole Number Reversal Trade that maybe established with the following conservative parameters. An entry point
may be placed at 1.3685 (15 PIPs ahead of the Whole Number 1.3700, which
serves as the starting point of the reversal after the unsuccessful comple-tion of the Large Quarter 1.3500 to 1.3750). The exit point could be set at
1.3535 (35 PIPs ahead of the target during the reversal Large Quarter Point
1.3500). These parameters would result in a conservative proﬁt target of150 PIPs. The stop may be placed at 1.3735 (50 PIPs above the entry point,
outside of the Overshoot Area 25 PIPs above the Whole Number 1.3700).
This would prevent the stop from being triggered during overshoots of theWhole Number 1.3700 preceding the Large Quarter Point 1.3750.

3-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory The 3-Day Rule of The Quarters Theory
requires a Large Quarter to be completed in a time period lasting no longer than
three trading days. The Quarters Theory allows three 24-hour trading sessions on
the global Foreign Exchange market as a sufﬁcient time period for the completionof a Large Quarter. A failure to complete a Large Quarter in three trading days
should be considered as a sign of price weakness and potential exhaustion that
could lead to the unsuccessful completion of the Large Quarter, resulting in a re-versal back towards the preceding Large Quarter Point.

in an attempt to reverse a previously established trend. These trend waves can “trig-
ger” a corrective trend pattern or could signal the beginning phase of a completetrend reversal.
Shortened Quarters Theory Trend Waves Cycle A Quarters Theory Trend Waves
Cycle consisting of less than three bullish or bearish trend waves in the same
direction.
Sign of Strength Bullish price behavior that causes prices to sustain at or above
a Large Quarter Point.
Sign of Weakness Bearish price behavior that causes prices to remain below a
Large Quarter Point.
Small Quarters The Quarters Theory divides the 100 PIP Ranges between two
whole numbers in currency exchange rates into four equal parts called “Small Quar-
ters”. Each 100 PIP Range contains four Small Quarters and each Small Quarter has
exactly 25 PIPs (100 PIP Range / 4 =25 PIPs).
Small Quarter Points The numbers that mark the beginning and the end of each
Small Quarter (Ex.: 1.3000, 1.3025, 1.3050, 1.3075, 1.3100 ...).
Small Quarter Price Moves Currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations in an orderly
series of price moves from one Small Quarter Point to the next, measured in in-crements of 25 PIPs, in a systematic effort to complete an entire Large Quarter of
250 PIPs.
Stop (Stop-loss) Order An order to close a trade at a predetermined price level in
order to avoid or limit losses.
Sub-Unit Decimalization The process of dividing the sub-units (1 cent, 1 penny,
1 centime) or the main unit of some currencies (e.g. 1 Yen) into 100 additional sub-units, called “Price Interest Points” or PIPs.
The Quarters Theory A theory based on the premise that currency exchange rates
ﬂuctuate in an orderly manner between the Large Quarter Points within each 1000PIP Range deﬁned by two Major Whole Numbers (Major Large Quarter Points). TheQuarters Theory proposes that every signiﬁcant price move in currency exchange
rates takes place from one Large Quarter Point to another, in gradual increments
of 250 PIPs - the range between two Large Quarter Points.
The Quarters Theory Trades Trades based on the methodology of The Quarters
Theory. The Quarters Theory Trades that take place within the familiar, constantLarge Quarter ranges of 250 PIPs.
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves A trend recognition method based on the
Elliott Wave Theory that focuses on proper recognition of bullish and bearish mar-ket cycles and patterns, called “trend waves”.

196 THE QUARTERS THEORY
The Quarters Theory Trend Waves Cycle Bullish or bearish trend pattern consist-
ing of recognizable series of Quarters Theory Trend Waves and price Corrections.
Time Stops Stop-loss orders that can be set not only by using time. Time stops
provide a clearly deﬁned period of time for each trade to reach its objective. If a
trade does not accomplish its goal in the speciﬁed time period, the trade may be
closed to either lock in proﬁts, or to avoid or limit losses.
Trader Objectives of The Quarters Theory Trades The Objectives of The Quarters
Theory Trades can be classiﬁed in two main categories: Large Quarter Completion
Trades that take advantage of the signiﬁcant price moves in currency exchange
rates from one Large Quarter Point to another, and Intra-Large Quarter Trades that
capitalize on the smaller price moves between the important price points within aLarge Quarter.
Trade Types The Trade Types of The Quarters Theory Trades are chosen depend-
ing on the Trade Objectives of The Quarters Theory Trades. If a trade has as itsobjective the completion of a Large Quarter, the trade types chosen may be: Large
Quarter Trade or Inverse Large Quarter Trade. If a trade’s objective is to capitalize
on the price moves within a Large Quarter, the suitable trade types would be: Hesi-tation Zone Trade/Hesitation Zone Reversal Trade, Overshoot Trade/Overshoot Re-
versal Trade, Half-Point Trade/Half-Point Reversal Trade, Whole Number Trade/
Whole Number Reversal Trade.
Trend Wave Failure The inability of a Quarters Theory Trend Wave to progress
the existing trend further. Trend Wave Failure usually leads to an attempt for atrend reversal with the development of a Reversal-Trigger Wave in the oppositedirection of the previously established trend.
Undershoot A price move that reaches the Undershoot Area within one Small
Quarter of 25 PIPs from a Large Quarter Point but comes short of “hitting” theexact number of the targeted Large Quarter Point.
Undershoot Area The range of one Small Quarter of 25 PIPs ahead of a Large
Quarter Point.
Unsuccessful Large Quarter Completion A price move from one Large Quarter
Point to another that fails to reach the vicinity of at least 25 PIPs (one Small Quar-ter) from the targeted Large Quarter Point.
Whole Numbers The whole numbers include the number zero and all of the count-
ing numbers.
Whole Number preceding a Large Quarter Point The Whole Number ahead of a
Large Quarter Point that could become the last support/resistance price point thatmay prevent the successful completion of a Large Quarter.
Whole Number Reversal Trade The Whole Number Reversal Trade is a Quarters
Theory trade that capitalizes on the reversal moves that take prices back to the

preceding Large Quarter Point as a result of a reversal at the Whole Number pre-
ceding a targeted Large Quarter Point.
Whole Number Trade The Whole Number Trade is a Quarters Theory trade that
takes advantage of the price moves within a Large Quarter, beginning from a
Large Quarter Point targeting the Whole Number preceding another Large Quarter
Point.
