## 8. ⏱️ **Micro Quarters Page (DEPRECATED)**

**Note:** Micro quarters (90-min & 22.5-min) are now INTEGRATED into Session Cycle page as fractional references. 

**This standalone page can either:**
1. Redirect to Session Cycle page
2. Focus purely on fractal theory concept
3. Be removed from navigation

## ✅ **Page Content Rules:**

### **Each Page Should Have:**
1. ✅ Time period clearly stated
2. ✅ A-M-D-X breakdown for THAT timeframe
3. ✅ Live tracking (where you are in cycle)
4. ✅ What to look for at each phase
5. ✅ Best trading period (always Q3/Distribution)
6. ✅ How it fits into larger cycle (one level up)
7. ✅ How it breaks down (one level down)

### **Each Page Should NOT Have:**
1. ❌ Detail from 2+ levels down
2. ❌ Unrelated timeframe information
3. ❌ Mixing multiple cycle levels
4. ❌ Redundant content from other pages

---

## 🎯 **Example: Quarter Cycle Page Should Show:**

✅ **INCLUDE:**

- Quarterly earnings impact
- GDP reports
- Quarter-end rebalancing
- Which month is best (Month 3 = Distribution)

❌ **DON'T INCLUDE:**
- Daily session detail
- 90-minute cycles
- Brinks Times
- Weekly day-by-day
- Yearly seasonal patterns (that's Yearly Cycle page)
