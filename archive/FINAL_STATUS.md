## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS (If Continuing):**

Add to `session-cycle.html`:
```javascript
function highlightCurrentSession() {
    const estTime = new Date(now.toLocaleString('en-US', { timeZone: 'America/New_York' }));
    const hours = estTime.getHours();
    let session = '';
    
    if (hours >= 19 || hours < 2) session = 'asian';
    else if (hours >= 2 && hours < 9) session = 'london';
    else if (hours >= 9 && hours < 17) session = 'ny';
    else session = 'pm';
    
    // Highlight session tab
}
```

### **Priority 2: Daily Sessions Live Tracking**
