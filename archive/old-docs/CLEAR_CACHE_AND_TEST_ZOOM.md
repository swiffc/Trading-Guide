## 🔧 What Zoom Sync Does

### It Automatically:

- ✅ Applies the same zoom to every page you visit
- ✅ Persists even after closing the browser
- ✅ Works with all zoom methods:
  - Ctrl + Plus/Minus
  - Ctrl + Mouse Wheel
  - Browser zoom menu

### Zoom Controls:
- **Ctrl + Plus (+):** Zoom in by 10%
- **Ctrl + Minus (-):** Zoom out by 10%
- **Ctrl + 0:** Reset to 100%

## 💡 Why You Need to Clear Cache

The browser has **cached the old version** of the pages (without zoom-sync.js). 

**Service Worker Cache:**
- Version is now **v3.3**
- Old cache (v3.2 or earlier) doesn't have zoom-sync.js
- Hard refresh forces new version

**After clearing cache once, it will work forever!**

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Zoom on Page A = 150%
- ❌ Navigate to Page B = 100% (resets)
- ❌ Navigate to Page C = 100% (resets)
- ❌ Have to re-zoom every page

### After Fix:
- ✅ Zoom on Page A = 150%
- ✅ Navigate to Page B = 150% (stays!)
- ✅ Navigate to Page C = 150% (stays!)
- ✅ Close browser, reopen = 150% (persists!)

## 🎉 Once Cache is Cleared

1. Set your preferred zoom **once** on any page
2. That zoom applies to **all 24 pages** automatically
3. Never worry about zoom again!

---

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If after clearing cache it still doesn't work:

1. **Check if localStorage is enabled:**
   - Open Console (F12)
   - Type: `localStorage.setItem('test', '1')`
   - Type: `localStorage.getItem('test')`
   - Should return: `"1"`

2. **Check browser extensions:**
   - Some extensions block localStorage
   - Try in Incognito mode (extensions disabled)

3. **Check browser version:**
   - Make sure you're using a modern browser
   - Chrome/Edge/Firefox (latest version)

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Script

Copy this into the Console (F12) to test manually:

```javascript
// Set zoom to 150%
localStorage.setItem('tradingGuideZoom', '1.5');
document.body.style.zoom = 1.5;
console.log('Zoom set to 150% - Navigate to another page to test!');
```

Then navigate to another page. If the zoom stays at 150%, it's working!

**Remember: Just do a Hard Refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) and it should work!** 🎯
