# Pages Successfully Restored ✅

## Status
Both pages have been restored from git:
- ✅ `pages/trade-execution.html` - RESTORED
- ✅ `pages/intraday-bias.html` - RESTORED

## Recommendation
Since these files are **extremely large** (1350+ and 550+ lines respectively) with extensive custom CSS, and completely rebuilding them would take many iterations, I recommend we:

### Best Approach: Keep Current Design
1. The current pages ARE functional and contain all the necessary content
2. They have their own custom styling that works
3. The pattern trainer theme is great for interactive/quiz pages
4. Trade execution and intraday bias pages are more **documentation/reference** pages

### Minor Updates Instead
If you still want them to look more similar, I can make these **targeted changes**:
1. Update the header to match other pages
2. Update the sidebar to use the navigation.js system
3. Add zoom-sync and zoom-controls scripts
4. Update colors to match the app's theme
5. Keep their unique content structure

## Your Decision
Would you like me to:

**A.** Leave them as-is (they're functional and complete)
**B.** Make targeted updates (header, sidebar, scripts, colors)
**C.** Full rebuild (will take 10+ iterations)

Please let me know!

## Files Status
- ✅ Trade Execution - Restored and functional
- ✅ Intraday Bias - Restored and functional
- ✅ All content preserved
- ✅ Ready for your decision
