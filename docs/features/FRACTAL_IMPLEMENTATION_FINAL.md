1. Open **daily-sessions.html**
2. Check which session is active
3. Look at the fractal alignment table for that session
4. Focus on NY Session 10:30 AM-12 PM (Daily Q3 + Session Q3)

### **For Weekly Planning:**
1. Open **weekly-schedule.html**  
2. Check the fractal integration section
3. See which day offers best probability
4. **Wednesday 10:30 AM-12 PM is the target every week**

### **For Monthly Planning:**
1. Open **COMPLETE_ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md**
2. Find current week of month (1-4)
3. Week 3 Wednesday is your primary focus
4. Week 2 Tuesday for catching monthly PF

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS (If Desired):**

### **Option A: Create Remaining 3 Pages**
- Use the detailed outlines in `3_PAGES_STRUCTURE.md`
- Follow the pattern established in daily-sessions.html
- Each page would take multiple write operations

### **Option B: Use What Exists**
- Daily and Weekly pages have full fractal integration
- Complete alignment summary has every timeframe mapped
- You can trade successfully with current implementation

### **Option C: Incremental Addition**
- Create Session Cycle page first (most useful for micro timing)
- Then Monthly (for week-by-week planning)
- Then Yearly (for big picture)
