# ðŸš€ Creating All Cycle Pages - Based on Quarterly Theory

## ðŸ“š **Source Framework:**

I'll create all pages based on Quarterly Theory principles:
- **A-M-D-X Cycle** (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution, Exit/Reversal)
- Fractal nature (same pattern at all timeframes)
- Q3 (Distribution) is always the best trading period
- Each timeframe divides into 4 quarters

## âœ… **Pages Being Created:**

### 1. **Session Cycle + Micro Quarters**
- Asian, London, NY, PM sessions
- 90-minute cycles within each
- 22.5-minute micro quarters
- Live tracking

### 2. **Monthly Cycle (30-Day)**
- 4 weeks as quarters
- Week 3 = best trading week
- Economic calendar integration
- NFP, CPI, FOMC timing

### 3. **Quarterly Cycle (90-Day)**
- 3 months as phases
- Month 3 = best trading month
- Earnings seasons
- Quarter-end flows

### 4. **Yearly Cycle (12-Month)**
- 4 calendar quarters
- Q3 (Jul-Sep) = best trading quarter
- Seasonal patterns
- Economic cycles
