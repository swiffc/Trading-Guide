# ðŸš€ Creating 4 Complete Cycle Pages

## **Status: IN PROGRESS**

Based on the exact Quarterly Theory framework from your images, I'm creating:

1. **Session Cycle + Micro** - Complete with all 90-min & 22-min cycles
2. **Monthly Cycle** - 4 weeks, 2nd Monday True Open
3. **Quarterly Cycle** - 3 months (90 days), April 1st yearly True Open  
4. **Yearly Cycle** - 4 calendar quarters, seasonal patterns

Each page includes:
- Exact timing from your images
- True Opens marked
- Judas Swing explained
- AMDX vs XAMD paths
- Live tracking
- What to do at each phase

**Creating now... This will take a few responses due to size.**

Starting with Monthly Cycle (easiest to understand), then Quarterly, Yearly, and Session Cycle (most complex).
