## 🎯 Core Concepts

### **The Fundamental Premise**

The Quarters Theory is based on the premise that **currency exchange rates fluctuate in an orderly manner** between Large Quarter Points within each 1000 PIP Range defined by Major Whole Numbers.

**Key Principle:** Every significant price move in currency exchange rates takes place from one Large Quarter Point to another, in gradual increments of **250 PIPs**.

### **Why It Works**

Currency prices follow the decimal numeral system, which creates natural psychological levels at:
- **Whole numbers** (1.3000, 1.3100, 1.3200...)
- **Half points** (.50 levels)
- **Quarter points** (.25, .50, .75 levels)

Traders and institutions naturally react at these "round" numbers, creating predictable support and resistance.

## 📊 Price Structure

### **1. Price Interest Points (PIPs)**

- **1 PIP** = 0.0001 in currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD)
- Smallest unit of price measurement
- **100 PIPs** = 1 cent/penny/centime
- **1,000 PIPs** = 10 cents
- **10,000 PIPs** = 1 Dollar/Euro/Pound

### **2. Major Whole Numbers**

The first numbers in each row of the table of whole numbers:
- Examples: **1.00, 1.10, 1.20, 1.30... 2.00...**
- Represent critical junctions
- Mark the beginning of new 1000 PIP Ranges

### **3. PIP Ranges Hierarchy**

```
1000 PIP Range (Major Whole Numbers)
    └── 4 Large Quarters (250 PIPs each)
        └── 10 Small Quarters (25 PIPs each)
            └── Individual PIPs
```

---

## 🎲 Quarter Points System

### **Large Quarters (250 PIPs)**

Each 1000 PIP Range is divided into **4 Large Quarters**:

**Example: 1.3000 to 1.4000**
1. **Q1:** 1.3000 → 1.3250 (250 PIPs)
2. **Q2:** 1.3250 → 1.3500 (250 PIPs)
3. **Q3:** 1.3500 → 1.3750 (250 PIPs)
4. **Q4:** 1.3750 → 1.4000 (250 PIPs)

### **Large Quarter Points**

The numbers that mark the beginning and end of each Large Quarter:
- **Examples:** 1.3000, 1.3250, 1.3500, 1.3750, 1.4000
- **Major Half Point:** The exact middle (e.g., 1.3500 in the 1.30-1.40 range)

### **Small Quarters (25 PIPs)**

Each 100 PIP Range (between whole numbers) is divided into **4 Small Quarters**:

**Example: 1.3000 to 1.3100**
1. 1.3000 → 1.3025 (25 PIPs)
2. 1.3025 → 1.3050 (25 PIPs)
3. 1.3050 → 1.3075 (25 PIPs)
4. 1.3075 → 1.3100 (25 PIPs)

### **Small Quarter Points**

- **Examples:** 1.3000, 1.3025, 1.3050, 1.3075, 1.3100
- **Major Small Quarter Points:** Coincide with whole numbers (1.3100, 1.3200, etc.)

---

## 📈 Key Price Zones

### **1. Hesitation Zone**

**Location:** The Small Quarter range (25 PIPs) **BEFORE** reaching a Large Quarter Point

**Example:** If targeting 1.3250:
- **Hesitation Zone:** 1.3225 to 1.3250

**Behavior:**
- Price may pause, consolidate, or reverse
- Traders become indecisive
- Momentum slows down

### **2. Overshoot Area**

**Location:** The Small Quarter range (25 PIPs) **BEYOND** a Large Quarter Point

**Example:** After reaching 1.3250:
- **Overshoot Area:** 1.3250 to 1.3275 (bullish)
- **Overshoot Area:** 1.3225 to 1.3250 (bearish)

**Behavior:**
- Price extends beyond the Large Quarter Point
- Often followed by reversal back to the Large Quarter Point

### **3. Undershoot Area**

**Location:** The Small Quarter range (25 PIPs) **BEFORE** a Large Quarter Point

**Behavior:**
- Price comes within 25 PIPs but fails to "hit" the exact Large Quarter Point
- Considered an unsuccessful completion

## 🌊 Trend Waves

The Quarters Theory uses a modified **Elliott Wave Theory** approach to identify trend cycles.

### **The Quarters Theory Trend Waves Cycle**

A complete cycle consists of **3 waves** in the same direction:

1. **Reversal-Trigger Wave 1** - Attempts to reverse existing trend
2. **Progressive Wave 2** - Extends the new trend further
3. **Conclusive Wave 3** - Completes the trend move

Between waves: **Corrective Waves** (pullbacks)

### **Wave Types**

#### **1. Reversal-Trigger Wave 1**

**Purpose:** Marks the beginning of a new trend cycle

**Characteristics:**
- First wave in new direction
- Attempts to reverse previously established trend
- Can trigger corrective pattern OR complete reversal
- Often coincides with Large Quarter Point

**Fibonacci Targets:**
- **38.2%** retracement of previous trend
- **50%** retracement
- **61.8%** retracement (strongest signal)

**Confirmation Needed:**
- Price sustains at or above Large Quarter Point (bullish)
- Price remains below Large Quarter Point (bearish)
- Volume increase
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD crossover)

#### **2. Progressive Wave 2**

**Purpose:** Extends the trend established by Wave 1

**Characteristics:**
- Capable of progressing existing trend further
- Typically longer than Wave 1
- Higher probability of success if Wave 1 confirmed strong
- Often targets next Large Quarter Point

**Fibonacci Extensions:**
- **127.2%** of Wave 1
- **161.8%** of Wave 1 (common)
- **200%** of Wave 1

**Entry Timing:**
- After corrective pullback following Wave 1
- Price holds above/below key support/resistance
- Momentum indicators confirm (RSI > 50 bullish, < 50 bearish)

#### **3. Conclusive Wave 3**

**Purpose:** Completes the trend cycle

**Characteristics:**
- Usually the strongest and longest wave
- Highest momentum
- Most reliable for Large Quarter completion
- Often extends to 3rd Large Quarter Point from origin

**Fibonacci Extensions:**
- **161.8%** to **200%** of Wave 1
- **261.8%** of Wave 1 (extended)
- **423.6%** of Wave 1 (rare but possible)

### **Consecutive Waves**

Multiple waves in the same direction without significant correction:

**Pattern:** Wave 1 → Wave 2 → Wave 3 → Wave 4 (rare)

**Indication:**
- Very strong trend
- Momentum increasing
- Often occurs during major fundamental shifts

### **Extended Waves**

Waves that are longer than expected:

**Characteristics:**
- Wave extends beyond normal Fibonacci projections
- Can be Wave 3 or Wave 5 in Elliott terms
- Indicates extremely strong momentum

### **Shortened Cycles**

Cycles with **less than 3 waves** in same direction:

**Pattern:** Wave 1 → Corrective Wave → Reversal

**Indication:**
- Weak trend
- Lack of follow-through
- Potential for quick reversal

### **Trend Wave Failure**

**Definition:** Inability of a Trend Wave to progress the trend further

**Result:**
- Usually leads to reversal attempt
- Development of Reversal-Trigger Wave in opposite direction
- Entry opportunity for Inverse Large Quarter Trade

**Signs of Failure:**
- Cannot reach next Large Quarter Point
- Reverses before completing 250 PIPs
- Breaks below/above previous corrective low/high

---

## 🔧 Technical Integration

### **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**

Use Fibonacci to identify optimal entry points for Progressive Wave 2:

**Key Levels:**
- **23.6%** - Shallow pullback (strong trend)
- **38.2%** - Moderate pullback
- **50%** - Standard pullback
- **61.8%** - Deep pullback (strongest reversal zone)
- **78.6%** - Very deep (trend may be reversing)

**How to Apply:**
1. Draw from start of Wave 1 to end of Wave 1
2. Wait for corrective pullback
3. Enter when price bounces at Fibonacci level
4. Confirm with Large Quarter Point support/resistance

### **Fibonacci Extensions**

Use extensions to project Wave 2 and Wave 3 targets:

**Key Levels:**
- **127.2%** - Minimum Wave 2 target
- **161.8%** - Golden ratio target (most common)
- **200%** - Strong extension
- **261.8%** - Wave 3 target
- **423.6%** - Extended Wave 3

**How to Apply:**
1. Draw from start of Wave 1 to end of Wave 1
2. Then from end of Wave 1 to end of correction
3. Extension levels show potential targets
4. Align with Large Quarter Points for best targets

### **Moving Averages**

**Recommended EMAs:**
- **5 EMA** - Immediate trend (15M-1H charts)
- **13 EMA** - Short-term trend
- **50 EMA** - Medium-term trend (align with Large Quarters)
- **200 EMA** - Long-term trend (align with 1000 PIP Ranges)

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** Price above 13 EMA (bullish), below 13 EMA (bearish)
- **Confirmation:** 13 EMA crossing 50 EMA
- **Trend:** 50 EMA direction indicates Large Quarter trend
- **Major Trend:** 200 EMA direction indicates 1000 PIP Range trend

### **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**

**Settings:** 12, 26, 9

**Signals:**
- **Bullish Crossover:** MACD line crosses above signal line
- **Bearish Crossover:** MACD line crosses below signal line
- **Divergence:** Price makes new high/low but MACD doesn't (reversal signal)
- **Zero Line:** Above = bullish trend, Below = bearish trend

**Integration:**
- Use MACD to confirm Reversal-Trigger Wave 1
- Crossover + Large Quarter Point hit = strong entry signal

### **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**

**Settings:** 14 periods

**Zones:**
- **Overbought:** > 70 (potential reversal or pullback)
- **Oversold:** < 30 (potential reversal or bounce)
- **Neutral:** 40-60 (no clear signal)

**Strategy:**
- **Entry:** RSI > 50 and rising (bullish), RSI < 50 and falling (bearish)
- **Hesitation Zone:** RSI divergence often occurs here
- **Overshoot:** RSI extreme (>80 or <20) signals overshoot

### **Stochastic Oscillator**

**Settings:** %K = 14, %D = 3, Slowing = 3

**Signals:**
- **Bullish:** %K crosses above %D in oversold zone (<20)
- **Bearish:** %K crosses below %D in overbought zone (>80)

**Integration:**
- Use for timing entries at Large Quarter Points
- Stochastic oversold + Large Quarter Point = strong buy
- Stochastic overbought + Large Quarter Point = strong sell

### **Chart Patterns**

**Trend Continuation:**
- **Flags/Pennants:** Point to next Large Quarter Point
- **Triangles:** Breakout direction aligns with Quarter move

**Trend Reversal:**
- **Head & Shoulders:** Often forms at Large Quarter Points
- **Double Top/Bottom:** Typically at Large Quarter Points
- **Cup & Handle:** Targets next Large Quarter Point

---

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### **The Three-Day Rule**

**Critical Rule:** Price must remain **above** (bullish) or **below** (bearish) a Large Quarter Point for **3 consecutive days** to confirm:
- **Sign of Strength:** Price sustains at or above Large Quarter Point
- **Sign of Weakness:** Price remains below Large Quarter Point

**Application:**
1. Wait 3 days after Large Quarter Point hit
2. If price holds → Enter Large Quarter Trade
3. If price fails → Look for reversal trade

### **Stop-Loss Strategies**

#### **1. Fixed PIP Stop**

**Conservative:** 25 PIPs (1 Small Quarter)
**Moderate:** 50 PIPs (2 Small Quarters)
**Aggressive:** 75-100 PIPs

#### **2. Large Quarter Point Stop**

Place stop just beyond previous Large Quarter Point:
```
Long Entry: 1.3250
Stop: 1.3240 (10 PIPs below Large Quarter Point)
```

#### **3. Technical Stop**

Place stop below/above:
- Key support/resistance
- Fibonacci retracement level
- Moving average (50 or 200 EMA)

### **Time Stops**

**Concept:** Close trade after specified time if target not reached

**Example:**
- Enter Large Quarter Trade
- Set 5-day time limit
- If not near target after 5 days → Close trade

**Benefit:** Frees up capital, prevents opportunity cost

### **Position Sizing**

**Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account Risk $) / (Stop Loss PIPs × PIP Value)
```

**Example:**
```
Account: $10,000
Risk per trade: 2% = $200
Stop Loss: 50 PIPs
PIP Value: $10 per PIP (standard lot EUR/USD)

Position Size = $200 / (50 × $10) = 0.4 lots
```

**Recommended Risk:**
- **Conservative:** 1% per trade
- **Moderate:** 2% per trade
- **Aggressive:** 3-5% per trade (not recommended)

### **Risk/Reward Ratios**

**Minimum Acceptable:** 1:2 (risk 1 to make 2)

**Quarters Theory Typical Ratios:**
- **Large Quarter Trade:** 1:5 (risk 50 to make 250)
- **Hesitation Zone Trade:** 1:9 (risk 25 to make 225)
- **Overshoot Trade:** 1:2.5 (risk 10 to make 25)
- **Whole Number Trade:** 1:8 (risk 25 to make 200)

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### **Large Quarter Points Calculator**

**For any Major Whole Number, Large Quarter Points are:**

**Example: 1.3000 to 1.4000 Range**

## 📊 Key Formulas

### **Position Size**
```
Position Size = (Account Risk $) / (Stop Loss PIPs × PIP Value)
```

### **PIP Value (Standard Lot)**
```
1 PIP = $10 for EUR/USD, GBP/USD
1 PIP = $10 for USD/JPY (adjusted for JPY rate)
```

### **Risk/Reward Ratio**
```
Risk/Reward = (Target PIPs) / (Stop Loss PIPs)

Example: Target 250, Stop 50 = 250/50 = 5:1 or 1:5
```

### **Account Risk Percentage**
```
$ at Risk = Account Size × Risk %

Example: $10,000 × 2% = $200 at risk per trade
```
