# üéØ Quarter Point Calculator - Complete Guide

## üìä What is the Quarter Point Calculator?

The Quarter Point Calculator is a powerful tool that combines **Ilian Yotov's Quarters Theory** (price-based) with **realistic ADR data** to help you identify key price levels where institutional traders operate.

---

## üéì Core Concepts

### What are Quarter Points?
Quarter Points are specific price levels that act as psychological support and resistance zones:
- **.00** - Whole number (strongest level)
- **.25** - First quarter
- **.50** - Mid-point (second strongest)
- **.75** - Third quarter

**Example:** For EUR/USD at 1.0850, the quarter points are:
- 1.0800 (.00)
- 1.0825 (.25)
- 1.0850 (.50) ‚Üê Current
- 1.0875 (.75)
- 1.0900 (.00)

### Why ADR-Based Calculations?
Instead of using fixed 250 PIP ranges (which don't work for all pairs), we calculate quarter points based on each pair's **Average Daily Range (ADR)**:

**Formula:**
```
Large Quarter (LQ) = ADR √ó 0.75 (75% of daily range)
Small Quarter (SQ) = LQ √∑ 5 (1/5 of Large Quarter)
Hesitation Zone (HZ) = SQ √∑ 2 (1/2 of Small Quarter)
```

This makes the system **realistic and adaptive** to each currency pair's volatility.

## üîß How to Use the Calculator

### Step 1: Select Your Currency Pair
Choose from 7 pre-configured pairs:
- **EUR/USD** (80 PIPs ADR) - Most liquid major
- **GBP/USD** (100 PIPs ADR) - Volatile major
- **USD/JPY** (70 PIPs ADR) - Major with different pip structure
- **AUD/USD** (60 PIPs ADR) - Medium volatility major
- **GBP/JPY** (150 PIPs ADR) - High volatility cross
- **EUR/JPY** (120 PIPs ADR) - High volatility cross
- **EUR/GBP** (50 PIPs ADR) - Low volatility cross
- **Custom ADR** - Enter your own ADR value

**üí° Pro Tip:** The ADR auto-populates when you select a pair!

### Step 2: Verify or Enter ADR
- For pre-configured pairs, the ADR is **automatically filled**
- For custom pairs, enter the ADR in PIPs
- You can calculate ADR using the **ADR Calculator** on the same page

### Step 3: Enter Current Price (Optional)
If you enter the current price (e.g., 1.08500), the calculator will show you:
- The 5 **nearest quarter point levels**
- Distance in PIPs from current price
- Direction (above ‚Üë or below ‚Üì)

### Step 4: Calculate
Click **"Calculate Quarter Points"** or press **Enter** to see results.

## üìà Understanding the Results

### 1. Large Quarter (LQ)
**Example:** 60 PIPs for EUR/USD

**Use For:**
- Swing trade targets (multi-day holds)
- Major support/resistance levels
- Weekly PSR targets
- Position profit targets

**Trading Strategy:**
- Enter on pullbacks to LQ levels
- Set TP at next LQ level
- Use for breakout targets

### 2. Small Quarter (SQ)
**Example:** 12 PIPs for EUR/USD

**Use For:**
- Intraday targets (same-day trades)
- Partial profit zones
- Scalping targets
- Daily session targets

**Trading Strategy:**
- Take partial profits at SQ levels
- Use for intraday reversals
- Combine with session quarters (90-Min, Micro)

### 3. Hesitation Zone (HZ)
**Example:** 6 PIPs for EUR/USD

**Use For:**
- Consolidation zones
- Reversal warning zones
- Breakout preparation areas
- Risk management zones

**Trading Strategy:**
- Watch for consolidation within HZ
- Apply **Three-Day Rule** (see below)
- Tighten stops near HZ levels
- Prepare for breakout moves

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Three-Day Rule

**Rule:** If price stays within a **Hesitation Zone** range for **3+ consecutive days**, expect a breakout move of **Large Quarter or more**.

**Example:**
- EUR/USD consolidates in a 6 PIP range (HZ) for 3 days
- Breakout likely to move 60+ PIPs (LQ)

**How to Trade It:**
1. Identify 3-day consolidation within HZ range
2. Place pending orders above/below the range
3. Target: 1 LQ minimum (60 PIPs for EUR/USD)
4. Stop Loss: Opposite side of consolidation range

### Example 2: GBP/JPY Intraday Trade

**Setup:**
- Pair: GBP/JPY
- ADR: 150 PIPs
- Current Price: 189.500

**Calculator Results:**
- Large Quarter: 113 PIPs (150 √ó 0.75)
- Small Quarter: 23 PIPs (113 √∑ 5)
- Hesitation Zone: 12 PIPs (23 √∑ 2)

**Nearest Quarter Points:**
- ‚Üë 190.000 (50 PIPs above)
- ‚Üë 189.750 (25 PIPs above)
- ‚óè 189.500 (0 PIPs - current)
- ‚Üì 189.250 (25 PIPs below)
- ‚Üì 189.000 (50 PIPs below)

**Trade Plan:**
1. Price at 189.500 (mid-level)
2. Watch for rejection at 190.000 (.00 level)
3. Enter short at 189.750 (confirmation)
4. Stop Loss: 190.000 (above resistance)
5. Target: 189.500 (SQ level) - 25 PIPs
6. Risk/Reward: 25 PIPs risk / 25 PIPs reward = 1:1 R:R

### Example 3: Three-Day Rule Breakout

**Setup:**
- Pair: EUR/GBP
- ADR: 50 PIPs
- Current Price: 0.85500

**Calculator Results:**
- Large Quarter: 38 PIPs
- Small Quarter: 8 PIPs
- Hesitation Zone: 4 PIPs

**Observation:**
- Price consolidates between 0.85480 - 0.85520 (4 PIP range = HZ)
- Consolidation lasts 3 days
- **Three-Day Rule activated!**

**Trade Plan:**
1. Place buy stop at 0.85530 (above consolidation)
2. Place sell stop at 0.85470 (below consolidation)
3. Target: 38 PIPs (LQ) from breakout point
4. If buy stop triggered at 0.85530, target 0.85910 (38 PIPs up)
5. Stop Loss: Opposite side of range (0.85470)
6. Risk/Reward: 6 PIPs risk / 38 PIPs reward = 1:6 R:R

## üîó Integration with Time-Based Quarters

The Quarter Point Calculator works **perfectly** with your existing time-based quarterly theory:

### Weekly PSR Zones + Quarter Points
1. Identify Weekly PSR High/Low (time-based)
2. Calculate quarter points from PSR levels (price-based)
3. Trade reversals at quarter point levels within PSR zones

**Example:**
- Weekly PSR High: 1.09000
- Weekly PSR Low: 1.08000
- Range: 100 PIPs
- Quarter Points within range:
  - 1.09000 (PSR High)
  - 1.08750 (Q3)
  - 1.08500 (Q2 - Mid)
  - 1.08250 (Q1)
  - 1.08000 (PSR Low)

### Daily Sessions + Quarter Points
1. Identify session highs/lows (Asian, London, NY)
2. Calculate SQ levels from session range
3. Use SQ for intraday targets

**Example:**
- Asian Session High: 1.08600
- Asian Session Low: 1.08400
- Range: 20 PIPs
- Small Quarter: 4 PIPs
- Targets: 1.08400, 1.08404, 1.08408, etc.

## üí° Pro Trading Tips

### 1. Combine with EMA Confluence
- Use 50 EMA + Quarter Points for entry
- Enter when price bounces off quarter point AND 50 EMA

### 2. Time + Price Confluence
- Wait for time-based quarter (Q3 Wednesday) + price-based quarter point
- Double confluence = higher probability

### 3. Volume Confirmation
- Watch for volume spikes at quarter point levels
- Institutional activity often happens at .00 and .50 levels

### 4. Multiple Timeframe Analysis
- Use LQ on Daily/4H charts for swing trades
- Use SQ on 1H/15M charts for intraday trades
- Use HZ on 5M/1M charts for scalping

### 5. Risk Management
- Never risk more than 1 SQ on a single trade
- Use HZ for tight stop placement
- Scale out at multiple SQ levels

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Should I use fixed 250 PIP quarters or ADR-based?**
A: ADR-based is more realistic. Fixed 250 PIPs only works for specific pairs like EUR/USD historically.

**Q: Can I use this for crypto or stocks?**
A: Yes! Just calculate the ADR for your asset and use custom ADR input.

**Q: How often should I recalculate ADR?**
A: Monthly or when market volatility changes significantly.

**Q: What if price is between quarter points?**
A: Wait for price to reach a clear quarter point level before entering.

**Q: Can I combine this with ICT concepts?**
A: Absolutely! Quarter points often align with Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, and Liquidity Zones.
